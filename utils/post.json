		"description" : "<p></p><p>We all know that the biggest challenge for owning a house is the ever increasing cost of construction. India has around&nbsp; 50 million middle class families ,looking for owning their own house.The average income of a Indian middle class family is around </p><p>Rs 25000/month.But the hard reality is that ,they cannot afford a house in their lifetime as the construction cost stays at Rs 3000/sq.ft in cities and 1500/sq.ft in Rural Areas.</p><p>Still ,there are options to have your own dream house.some smart steps and little steps will allow you to reach you goal.let’s look into some possibilities..</p><h3>1.Never build your home to impress others..</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest cultural flow is that ,Indians build homes to impress or win over their neighbours and relatives.it not only skyrocket your cost ,but lead&nbsp; you into huge financial issues.so always be careful that don’t be into that and plan the house only you require.</p><h3>2.Get the suitable plan for your house.</h3><p>&nbsp; The best method is to find an architect of your choice.Tell them your requirements exactly ,how many members your family has,what is your budget.For a small family of 3 Members usually require only 1000-1500 sq.ft fo decent living.above that is luxury and significantly increase your project cost.Architect cost will be around Rs 25-250/sq.ft as per their experience on an average.Fortunately ,you can save much on this by purchasing plans online.our <a href=\"www.arclif.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">website</a> provide complete set of drawings absolutely free or on little cost.you can even ask for customization with additional charges.</p><h3>3. Planning makes man perfect..get everything planned.</h3><p>&nbsp;After getting the right&nbsp; House plans, Spend atleast 1 week for planning your project.plan everything from finding architects to getting the right labours/contractors.Get all your funds ready before construction starts.talk to your bank for lowest interest rates.if possible ,write down each milestones ,for eg..completion of foundation,main slab etc..</p><p>Discuss your house plan with some experts in your locality and get the right advice.research about the materials you are going to apply and find the best materials at best price.you can get various tools for planning at website Arclif.com</p><h3>4. Beauty is not always expensive..</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Use simple and beautiful things to decorate your interiors that are available in your surroundings or neighbourhoods.for eg.You can use Bamboosfor creating internal partitions , old wooden logs as seats in you courtyard..you can find tonnes of ideas on internet ..checkout on pinterest ,arclif.com,houzz.com etc..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Use Space optimization techniques..&nbsp;</h3><p>The biggest mistake all home owners make is that construction of unwanted space..When each sq.ft cost you around Rs 2500 ,reducing&nbsp; 100 sq.ft ,will&nbsp; save you Rs 2.5 Lakhs..i.e. around &nbsp;15% of your project cost.(Appr.Budget 18-20lakhs).if you are&nbsp; family of 3 members ,you don’t even have to think of first floor. discuss this points with your architect/Engineer before starting the drawings.Avoid multiple kitchens and plan to have multipurpose spaces.</p><h3>6.Have a solid agreement with contractor.</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every project Involves single/multiple&nbsp; contractors.the most important thing is that you should make a binding agreement with them regarding the construction cost,payment terms and most important..delivery time.120 days of delay will cost you approx.5-10% increase in project cost.Mention the quality/Brand&nbsp; of materials using for construction at the time of agreement.</p><h3>7.Bargain at every point of purchase.</h3><p>&nbsp; Current economic situation is an opportunity for home seekers. you can get most of the products/services at rock bottom prices.Try some newer brands with good quality and definitely they will agree on your terms.even banks will be ready to give you attractive interest rates.</p>",

		"description" : "<h2><strong>Can Staircase Design Shape Your Feelings?</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As artists and writers know, it usually helps if you understand the rules before you start experimenting. This is especially true in architecture where you are bound not just by your imagination but by the physical laws and what is possible within the limits of construction techniques and materials</p><p>A&nbsp;stairway,&nbsp;staircase,&nbsp;stairwell,&nbsp;flight of stairs, or simply&nbsp;stairs,&nbsp;is a construction designed to bridge a large vertical &nbsp;distance by dividing it into smaller vertical distances, called&nbsp;steps. Stairs may be straight, round, or may consist of two or more straight pieces connected at angles.</p><p>Read on to see eight popular types of stairs, ranging from no-frills to in-your-face elaborate. Bring your favourites to your architect and contractor to discuss what makes the most sense for your home.</p><p></p><p><u><strong>Different types of stairs</strong></u></p><p></p><p><strong>1.STRAIGHT</strong></p><p>Straight stairs feature a single linear flight with no change in direction.</p><p><strong>2 L-SHAPED.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The classic straight style, turned up a little. In this design, the stairs make a 90-degree turn at some point, going left or right after a landing.</p><p><strong>3. WINDER</strong></p><p>The slightly more complicated sister to the L-shaped staircase. A set of winders—treads that are wider on one side than the other—takes the place of the landing to save space.</p><p><strong>4.U SHAPED</strong></p><p>If you've ever promised yourself you'd take the stairs every day at your office, you've seen this back-to-basics style. The bend is taken even further to form a full U shape, and similar to the L-shaped staircase, a landing separates the two parallel flights</p><p><strong>&nbsp;5. SPIRAL</strong></p><p>A compact design centered around a single pole, so that if you looked at it from above, it would form a perfect circle. Something to consider: A spiral staircase's narrow wedge-shaped treads aren't the easiest to traverse. (Avoid them if you're clumsy.)</p><p><strong>6.CURVED</strong></p><p>Unlike winder or L-shaped staircases, a curved style has no landings. Instead, the stairs are continuous, following the bend of the banister to make a striking architectural statement.</p><p><strong>7.BIFURCATED</strong></p><p>The grandest of them all—this is the style of the iconic&nbsp;<em>Titanic</em>&nbsp;staircase—bifurcated stairs include one sweeping set of steps that splits off into two smaller flights going in opposite directions.</p><p><strong>8.LADDER</strong></p><p>No explanation needed here. Small-home owners desperate for even the tiniest extra sliver of square footage could go this route.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

		"description" : "<p><strong>LIGHTING IN LIVING ROOMS</strong></p><p>Lighting can have a major influence on the look and feel of your home. Good lighting helps you see better, perform tasks more easily, and creates a sense of security and comfort in a space. While lighting controls allow you to adjust your lights to suit a particular time of day or activity, light fixtures let you add another dimension of style to your home. Light sources, from familiar incandescent lights to more advanced, energy-efficient LED lights, not only help you see but can save you money on your monthly energy bills.&nbsp;All these options make it possible to design a versatile and creative home lighting scheme.</p><p>When planning the lighting for each room in your home, proceed with the following tips in mind:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Consider the ambiance you want to create in each space.</p></li><li><p>Consider the activities in each room (cooking, reading, hobbies, grooming, laundry, homework, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Consider any decorative elements you want to emphasize, such as artwork or architectural features.</p></li><li><p>Consider the energy-efficiency,&nbsp;brightness, color temperature, and CRI of your lights.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp; Living Room Lighting</h2><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its the place where you watch TV, read books, play games and entertain guests, the living room is easily the most dynamic area of the home. Therefore, it should have great lighting fit for both function and ambiance. Although every living room is different and requires a unique lighting design, there are a few key elements all good living room lighting schemes have. Living room lighting should always incorporate each of the three layers of lighting design—ambient, task, and accent lighting—with a&nbsp;<strong>fixture and light quality</strong>&nbsp;that best suits the room’s mood, architectural features, and purpose. Let’s take a look at a few lighting options with these factors in mind</p><ul><li><p><strong>Backlighting&nbsp;</strong>is when you place light behind an object to create the illusion of depth, typically using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.1000bulbs.com/category/tape-light-led/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">LED tape light</a>  In the living room, some of the best places to use back light accents include inside alcoves, under cabinets, beneath furniture, behind screens or displays, and underneath steps.</p></li><li><p><strong>Display lighting</strong>&nbsp;is when light is directed onto areas or objects you want to make more prominent in a room. You may want to use display lighting in your living room if you have decorative objects resting on alcoves or shelves inside large, glass-door cabinets. You may also want to better display artwork on your walls or above your fireplace. Relfector bulbs are commonly used for display lighting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uplighting&nbsp;</strong>involves using fixtures to direct light upwards, typically to illuminate high or vaulted ceilings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.1000bulbs.com/product/5761/IN-0060CLSB.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Silver crown bulbs</a>&nbsp;and certain lamp shades can deflect light upwards when used in standing or table lamps, and select&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.1000bulbs.com/category/vanity-and-wall-light-fixtures/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">wall lights</a>&nbsp;mounted higher on the middle-third of your walls can also direct light up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wall-washing</strong>&nbsp;is accomplished by directing light towards features on your wall. This technique is typically used to expand boundaries or call attention to positive aspects of a room. Create a wall-washing effect with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.1000bulbs.com/search/?q=eyeball\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">recessed eyeball lights</a>, track lights, or other directional fixtures.</p></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

		"description" : "<p>The pandemic named CORONA (COVID19) originated in the city of Wuhan, China has made dramatic changes in our lives. The only predictable thing is that the world will be an entirely different place after corona. At the time of writing, there are 3.2 Million confirmed cases and, More than 1,00,000 death reported across the globe.</p><p>How this is going to affect the architecture industry?</p><h3>1.Virus proof surfaces and Materials.</h3><p>One of the major considerations in architecture will be to adopt virus-proof surfaces/materials .the spread of corona through surface contacts was a major concern .as of now there are not many solutions available, but definitely, a lot of research is undergoing in Nanotechnology.</p><h3>2.Hygiene will be of very high priority.</h3><p>Architects will have to consider hygiene with high priority, especially, on the design of public facilities like movie theaters, malls, transport facilities etc..Most people have already turned hygiene conscious and may turn reluctant to visit places that have lower cleaning and hygiene facilities.</p><h3>3.Social distancing will become a habit rather than a necessity.</h3><p>The biggest behavioral change is visible in socializing. With the help of the latest technologies and applications, it is possible to enjoy any event in the comfort of home. So the days with crowded events and conferences will have a bad time, for at least some years. online shopping is the new norm and people may not want to take the risk of going outside into crowded markets. this will hurt the architecture industry for short to mid-term.</p><h3>4.Work at Home will be the trend in the coming decade</h3><p>Major tech companies have already announced work from home (WFH) will be implemented at least 50% of its employees.this will have a considerable impact on commercial real estate business. At the same time quality, residential buildings will see higher demand in the coming years.architects may have to ensure additional spaces for working at home in their designs.</p><h3>5.Increase in the number of hospitals and public medical facilities</h3><p>Countries having low public healthcare facilities witnessed the biggest disaster in the pandemic crisis. Better economies like the US, Germany, UK, etc are expected to spend billions of dollars in healthcare facilities in the coming decade. Architects should reskill themselves to adapt and take advantage of this opportunity.</p><h3>6.Virtual meetings and conferences</h3><p>Most of the conferences will be done online, so the companies can save a considerable amount of their operational expenses. As an architect, there will be bigger savings as time, that could have lost during traveling .we can use this time for other productive activities.</p><h3>7.More space requirement between seats in public places.</h3><p>There will be a major shift in architectural standards for seating designs. Additional space would be required between seats especially in public facilities. The number of occupants allowed in a facility might be also reduced .this will create fresh challenges, in the architecture perspective.</p><p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@victorhwn725?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Victor He</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/corona?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Unsplash</a></p>",

ഫൈഫാ മല കേറാനുള്ള റോഡ് എത്തി.ഒരു വണ്ടിക്കു മാത്രം പോവാൻ പറ്റുന്ന വീതിയുള്ള റോഡ്.കൂടാതെ പെട്ടന്നുള്ള വളവും കേറ്റവും, മാത്രമല്ല റോഡിന്റെ ഇടതു വശം പല സ്ഥലത്തും ഒരു സുരക്ഷമതിൽ പോലും ഇല്ല.മഴ പെയ്തു കഴിഞ്ഞാൽ റോഡിലേക്ക്&nbsp;&nbsp;കല്ലിടിയും,റോഡിൽ ചെറിയ കുഴികളും കാണാം. എവിടെങ്കിലും കുറച്ചു വീതി കൂടുതൽ ഉണ്ടെങ്കിൽ അവിടെ വണ്ടികൾ നിർത്തിയിട്ടുണ്ടാവും.നിർത്തിയിട്ട വണ്ടികൾ എല്ലാം ആക്രിവണ്ടികൾ ആണെന്ന് തോന്നും കാരണം ഓരോ വണ്ടികളും ഒരു 10 വട്ടമെങ്കിലും ഇടിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടാകും. അവിടെ ഉള്ളവർക്ക് അതൊരു ശീലമാണെന്നു തോന്നുന്നു.</p><p>അങ്ങനെ&nbsp; മേലേ എത്തി.മനോഹരമായ തട്ടുതട്ടായ മലനിരകൾ പച്ചപ്പിന്റെ&nbsp;ഹൃദ്യതയും ചെറിയ രീതിയിൽ മഴത്തുള്ളികൾ പെയ്യുന്നു.പക്ഷെ ആരെ മുഖത്തും വലിയ സന്തോഷം കാണുന്നില്ല. സ്ത്രീകൾ എല്ലാം പേടിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്‌. കുട്ടികൾ ഒരു രസം. വീഗ ലാൻഡിൽ roller coaster പോയ പോലെ എന്ന്. അവിടത്തെ മണ്ണ് കൊണ്ടുണ്ടാക്കിയ പഴയ വീടുകളും പിന്നെ ഇടക്കൊക്കെ വലിയ വീടുകളും ഉണ്ട്.എന്തായാലും അവിടത്തെ view ആസ്വദിച്ചു ഞങ്ങൾ അവിടെ നിന്നിറങ്ങി.Trekking എല്ലാം scope ഉള്ള സ്ഥലമാണ്.ഇറക്കുമ്പോൾ കുത്തനെ ഉള്ള ഇറക്കമായതു കൊണ്ട് മെല്ലെ ബ്രേക്ക് ചവിട്ടി ഇറക്കുന്നത്. കുറച്ചു കഴിഞ്ഞപ്പോ എനിക്ക് ഇടക്കൊക്കെ ബ്രേക്ക് കുറയുന്നത് പോലെ സംശയം. ഞാൻ ജിനേഷിനെ അറിയിപ്പിച്ചു വണ്ടി ഒതുക്കി കുറച്ചു കഴിഞ്ഞു പോവാമെന്നു പറഞ്ഞു. അങ്ങനെ വീണ്ടും യാത്ര തുടർന്ന് മല ഇറങ്ങി. എനിക്ക് ബ്രേക്കിന്റെ കാര്യത്തിൽ പൂർണ വിശ്വാസം വന്നിട്ടില്ല.എന്റെ PRADO നിർത്തിയതിന്റെ പിന്നിലായിരുന്നു ജിനേഷിന്റെ RAV4 നിർത്തിയത്. brakepad അമിതമായി ചൂടായതിനാൽ ആണ് ബ്രേക്ക് കുറഞ്ഞത്.കുറച്ചു കഴിഞ്ഞു പരിശോധിച്ചപ്പോൾ കുഴപ്പമില്ല യാത്ര തുടരാമെന്ന് ഞാൻ ജിനേഷിനോട് പറഞ്ഞു. അപ്പോൾ വണ്ടി എടുക്കാൻ വേണ്ടി ഞാൻ കേറി.അപ്പൊ പിന്നിൽ വന്നു എന്തോ വന്നിടിച്ചു.വണ്ടിയിൽ ആർക്കും ഒന്നും സംഭവിച്ചിട്ടില്ല.ഇറങ്ങി നോക്കിയപ്പോ ജിനേഷിന്റെ വണ്ടി എടുത്തപ്പോ ബ്രേക്ക് ചവിട്ടിയിട്ടു കിട്ടിയില്ല.ജിനേഷിന്റെ മകൾ ലച്ചു പേടിച്ചിട്ടു കരയുന്നുണ്ടായിരുന്നു.ഞാൻ സമാദനിപ്പിച്ചു.ജിനേഷും പേടിച്ചിരുന്നു. വണ്ടി ഞാൻ പിന്നിലോട്ടു വലിച്ചെടുത്തു. കമ്പനിയുടെ നടപടി ക്രമപ്രകാരം വണ്ടി ഇടിച്ചാൽ transport coordinator വിവരം അറിയിപ്പിച്ചു പോലീസ് റിപ്പോർട്ട് സമർപ്പിക്കണം. പോലീസിനെ വിളിച്ചു അറിയാവുന്ന മുറി അറബിയിൽ കാര്യങ്ങൾ പറഞ്ഞു മനസ്സിലാക്കാൻ ശ്രമിച്ചു.പക്ഷെ സമയം ഒത്തിരി ആയിട്ടും വരുന്നത് കാണുന്നല്ല, അപ്പോൾ അത് വഴി ഒരു സൗദി പോയത് അയാൾ കാര്യങ്ങൾ അന്ന്വേഷിച്ചു.എന്താണ് പ്രശ്നം എന്നും ഇത് ഇവിടെ സാധരണ ആണെന്നും അവർ പറഞ്ഞു വർക്ഷോപ്പിൽ ഒന്നും കൊണ്ട് പോവണ്ട വണ്ടി തണുത്തു കഴിഞ്ഞാൽ ബ്രേക്ക് സാധാ രീതിയിൽ ആവും. സൗദി എന്റെ ഫോണിൽ നിന്നും പോലീസിനെ വിളിച്ചു എത്രയും പെട്ടന്ന് എത്തണം കുടുംബമായി നിക്കാണെന്നു പറഞ്ഞു. പിന്നെ പോലീസ് എത്തി ഞങ്ങളോട് സ്റ്റേഷൻ വരെ വരാൻ പറഞ്ഞു. അവരെ പിന്നാലെ ഞങ്ങൾ സ്റ്റേഷൻ എത്തി. അവിടെ എത്തിയപ്പോ ശരിക്കും പെട്ടു എന്നായി.പോലീസ്‌കാർക്കാർക്കും ഇംഗ്ലീഷും അറിയില്ല ഞങ്ങൾക്കാണെങ്കിൽ അറബിയും. ജിനേഷിന്റെ വിചാരം എനിക്ക് അത്യാവശ്യം അറബി അറിയാമെന്നാണ്. കാരണം പല സ്ഥലത്തും മുറി അറബി വെച്ച് ഞാൻ രക്ഷപ്പെടാറുണ്ട്. എന്ത് കൊണ്ടോ ചില സാഹചര്യത്തിൽ അറിയാവുന്ന വാക്കുകൾ പോലും പുറത്തു വരില്ല. പിന്നെ ഒന്നും നോക്കിയില്ല ആംഗ്യഭാഷ ആയിരുന്നു കൂടുതലും. അവസാനം അവര് ഒരു പേപ്പർ തന്നു. അത് പോലീസ് റിപ്പോർട്ട് അല്ലെങ്കിലും ഞങ്ങൾ coordinator പറഞ്ഞ പ്രകാരം ആ പേപ്പർ വാങ്ങി തിരിച്ചു പൊന്നു.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ഫൈഫാ മല നല്ല തണുപ്പും കോടമഞ്ഞും പച്ചപ്പും കൃഷിയും വിത്യസത്മായ സംസ്കാരവും മനോഹരമായ അനുഭവങ്ങൾ ആവുമെങ്കിലും ഞങ്ങൾക്ക് ശരിക്കും ആസ്വദിക്കാൻ കഴിഞ്ഞില്ല.പക്ഷെ എല്ലാ യാത്രകളും നമ്മൾ plan ചെയ്ത പോലെ ആവണമെന്നില്ല. യാത്രകളിൽ ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടുകൾ നേരിടേണ്ടി വരും.അതിൽ നമ്മൾക്ക് പരിചയമില്ലാത്ത പലരും നമ്മളെ സഹായിക്കും.വഴിയിൽ കിടന്നപ്പോ വെള്ളവും ഭക്ഷണവും നൽകി ചിലർ. അതൊക്കെ നല്ല മനുഷ്യരെയും കാണാനുള്ള സാഹചര്യം ഒരുക്കും.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>വാദി ലജബ്‌...</strong></p><p>ജെക്കിൽ നിന്ന് 110 km അകലെയാണ് വാദി ലജബ്‌ സ്ഥിതി ചെയ്യുന്നത്. ജിസാൻ പ്രവിശ്യയിൽ ജബൽ കഹാറിലെ ഒരു വിസ്മയ ലോകമാണ് വാദി ലജബ്‌. വാദി എന്നാൽ അരുവി എന്നാണു. വാദികൾ മഴക്കാലമല്ലെങ്കിൽ വരണ്ടതായിരിക്കും.പക്ഷെ ലാജബ്‌ വർഷത്തിൽ ഉടനീളം അരുവികൾ ഒഴുകുന്നത് കാണാം. പ്രകൃതി ഭംഗിയോടൊപ്പം സാഹസികത കൂടി ഉദ്ദേശിക്കുന്നവർക്ക്‌ സന്ദർശിക്കാൻ പറ്റിയ ഒരിടമാണ് മരുഭൂമിയിലെ ഈ വിസ്മയം. രണ്ടോ മൂന്നോ പ്രാവിശ്യം ലജബിൽ പോയിട്ടുണ്ട് ഞങ്ങൾ ഓഫിസിനു ഒരു വെള്ളിയാഴ്ച രാവിലെ നേരത്തെ ലജബിലേക്കു ലക്‌ഷ്യം വെച്ചിറങ്ങി.മഹല്ല എന്ന് പറയുന്ന ജംഗ്ഷനിൽ നിർത്തി കഴിക്കാൻ കുറച്ചു പഴങ്ങൾ,snacks, ജ്യൂസ് എന്നിവ വാങ്ങി യാത്ര തുടർന്നു. ഇവിടെയും പോവുന്ന വഴി ധാരാളം കുരങ്ങുകൾ റോഡിൻറെ ഇരുവശവും കാണാം.ജിസാനിലും ഫൈഫയിലും കണ്ട പോലെ ഗ്രാമീണ സൗദികൾ.പട്ടണത്തിൽ കാണുന്നവരെ പോലെ അല്ല ഒരു ആർഭാടവുമില്ല. ഒരു കുന്നിരിങ്ങായപ്പോൾ പെട്ടന്ന് ബോർഡ് കണ്ടു WADI LAJAB ഇടത്തോട്ട്. ആ റോഡ് കല്ലുകൾ കൂട്ടിയിട്ടു ഉണ്ടാക്കിയ റോഡ് പോലെ ഉണ്ട്.ഉള്ളിലോട്ടു മല വെട്ടി നിരത്തി ഉണ്ടാക്കിയ വഴി പോലെ.വർഷക്കാലത്തെ നാട്ടിൻപുറത്തെ മഴവെള്ളം പരന്നൊഴുകുന്ന റോഡ് പോലെ. വാദി ലജബിന്റെ ഒരു പ്രധാന പ്രശ്നം വരുന്നത് നമ്മൾ ഉള്ളിൽ ഉണ്ടാകുമ്പോൾ മഴ പെയ്താൽ എല്ലാ മലയിലെ വെള്ളം ഒളിച്ചു അത് വഴി വളരെ ശക്‌തമായി വരും. ഞങ്ങൾ ഉള്ളിലോട്ടു വണ്ടി എടുക്കാനോ എന്ന് സംശയമായി.പിന്നെ അത് വഴി ധാരാളം വണ്ടികൾ പോവുന്നത് കണ്ടു. അങ്ങനെ വണ്ടി എടുത്തു മുന്നോട്ടു പോവാൻ തീരുമാനിച്ചു.ഒരു വണ്ടിക്കു മാത്രം പോവാൻ പറ്റുന്ന വഴി. വലിയ ഒരു മല നെടുകെ പിളർത്തിയ പോലെയുള്ള വഴി.നൂറ്റാണ്ടുകളായി വെള്ളമൊഴുകി സംഭവിച്ചതായിരിക്കും ഈ വഴി. വണ്ടി ഒതുക്കി ഞങ്ങൾ പുറത്തിറങ്ങി.തണുത്ത വെള്ളം ഒഴുകുന്ന നല്ല തണുത്ത പ്രതീതി.മരുഭൂമി ആണെന്ന് ഒരിക്കലും തോന്നിപ്പിക്കാത്ത വിധം മരങ്ങളും&nbsp;ചെടികളും. മലകളുടെ ചുവരുകളിൽ നിന്ന് വെള്ളത്തിന്റെ ഉറവകളും ഒഴുകുന്നത് കാണാം.ഒരു 1 km അതിൽ കൂടുതൽ വണ്ടി പോവില്ല. അവിടെ വണ്ടി നിർത്തണം. നല്ല രീതിയിൽ തിരക്കുണ്ടവിടെ. സൗദികളും വിദേശികളും എല്ലാവരുമുണ്ട്. സൗദികൾ carpet വിരിച്ചു പാട്ടും സംഗീതോപരണങ്ങളും കാവയും BBQ, ഹുക്കയുമൊക്കെ ആയി രാവിലെ മുതൽ സ്ഥലം പിടിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്. ഒരു പുഴയുടെ തീരത്തെത്തിയ പ്രതീതി. പക്ഷികളുടെ കിളിനാദം വെള്ളമൊഴുകുന്നതിന്റെ ശബ്ദം.&nbsp;ഞങ്ങൾ ആവശ്യമുള്ളതെല്ലാം ബാഗിൽ എടുത്തു നടക്കാൻ തുടങ്ങി.കല്ലിനടിയിലൂടെ തണുത്ത വെള്ളമൊഴുകുന്നു.മനസ്സും ശരീരവും തണുത്തു തുടങ്ങി. നടന്നെത്തിയത് പാറക്കെട്ടുകൾ നിറഞ്ഞ ഒരിടത്താണ്. അതിന്റെ നടുവിൽ ഒരു വെള്ളക്കെട്ടും.അവിടെ ആവശ്യത്തിൽ കൂടുതൽ ആളുണ്ട്. വീണ്ടും ഉള്ളിലേക്ക് നടന്നു. വലിയ പാറക്കെട്ടുകൾ കയറി ഇറങ്ങി. പുതിയ വഴി കണ്ടു പിടിച്ചു.പോവുന്നത് ശരിക്കും ആസ്വദിച്ചു. കൂട്ടത്തിൽ ഞാനായിരുന്നു മുന്നിൽ വഴികാട്ടി. ആകാശം മുട്ടി നിൽക്കുന്ന പർവത ഭിത്തികൾ പാറക്കെട്ടുകൾ തുടക്കത്തിൽ കണ്ട നിറമല്ല.തുടക്കത്തിൽ ചുവപ്പായിരുന്നെങ്കിൽ ഇപ്പോൾ ചാരവും കറുപ്പും നിറമുള്ള പാറകളാണ്. തെളിഞ്ഞ ശുദ്ധമായ വെള്ളം ഒഴുകി പോവുന്നതിൽ പരല്മീനുകൾ പോവുന്നത് തെളിഞ്ഞു കാണുന്നുണ്ട്.&nbsp;ഞങ്ങൾ ഏറെ ദൂരം പോന്നിരുന്നു എന്ന് മനസ്സിലായപ്പോ അടുത്ത കാണുന്ന സ്ഥലത്തു നിർത്തണമെന്ന് വിചാരിച്ചു. നോക്കിയാൽ കാണാത്ത ദൂരത്തിൽ പാറക്കെട്ടുകൾ.അങ്ങനെ ഞങ്ങൾ ഒരു വെള്ളച്ചാട്ടവും വെള്ളക്കെട്ടും കണ്ടു.ഞാൻ ഇറങ്ങി പരിശോദിച്ചു ആഴം ഉറപ്പു വരുത്തി.നാട്ടിലെ പോലെ പരൽമീനുകൾ തവളകൾ എല്ലാമുണ്ട്. അങ്ങനെ എല്ലാവരും അവിടെ ചാടി. നല്ല തണുത്ത വെള്ളം.കയ്യിലുള്ള fruits ജ്യൂസ് എല്ലാം കഴിച്ചു ഏകദേശം ഒരു മണിക്കൂര് കഴിഞ്ഞു ഞങൾ അവിടിന്നു യാത്ര തിരിച്ചത്.തിരിച്ചു വരുന്ന വഴി ജിസാൻ ഭാഗത്തെ പ്രധാന കാർഷിക വിളയായ വാഴ കൃഷി തോട്ടത്തിൽ ഒന്ന് കേറി. റോബസ്റ്റ പോലെയുള്ള ഇനത്തിൽ പെടുന്ന യാമണിപ്പഴമെന്ന പേരിലാണ് സൗദിയിലെ മലയാളികൾ ഇതിനെ വിളിക്കാറ്. അവിടെ നിന്ന് സാബിയയിൽ നിന്ന് ഷവായ housil കേറി ഭക്ഷണം കഴിച്ചു ഞങ്ങൾ മടങ്ങി.</p>",

Another landmark project palm jumeirah  was also taking shape. I often wondered  how such a small   country like this can make the rest of the world envious. It was  the sheer will power of His highness  sheikh Mohammed ,the visionary  ruler of Dubai.</p><p>Everything went well until  the beginning  of 2010. Slowly,  the  economic issues in western countries like US and some countries from Europe  started to be visible on our project.</p><p>Later the statement we expected came that our project will be put on hold for a while. We were  left without salary for a few months , until we tried  to get our new jobs. I moved to  India for a while  to  return  back after a vacation. </p><p>I always  thought  of the achievement  made by Dubai in a very short time.i was fortunate to work in this part of world until 2016. We  visit dubai every  year  to meet my parents  and the transition  is visible in most venues of people  living  in dubai.the economic conditions  hae not improved much and construction  activities  still at a very meagre level.</p>",

The building will maintain the close connection to the outdoors that is an integral aspect of the school’s curriculum.</p><p>The building will have two floors of classrooms, offices and restrooms. The classrooms will have operable walls which will allow the flexibility to be connected and accommodate multiple functions. The open corridors on the first and second level will have open areas that will be used as outdoor classroom areas. A portion of the building will initially be used as a covered activities area that will accommodate play as well as performance space. This area will be enclosed for additional classrooms and offices in the future when the Phase III Arts Center is added to the campus.</p><p>This building will have 14,000 sf of heated space and 10,000 sf of usable outdoor covered space.</p>",

		"description" : "<p></p><p>A façade refers to one side of a building usually the front side which is an integral piece to make the entire building looks better. It is the most important part which gives a personality and character to the <a href=\"http://arclif.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">building</a>. Façade varies in different shapes and sizes and it gives the overall building a life and showcases their talents. Facades play an important role in building a life for the building. Any building can create a recognizable façade in the available area. Most of the buildings have recognizable facades and there exist restrictions in altering facades. This also specifies the importance of not just the building but to the environment around. Curtain walls normally facades without structural impact and are considered as a separate structure which is attached to the building.</p><p>Here at <a href=\"http://arclif.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Arclif</a>, we are passionate to demonstrate how modern architecture can uphold beauty in facades. Due to environmental credentials, installation, and cost timber cladding is the best option. Timber cladding provides stunning aesthetics to the building. Using timber to blend with the facades naturally blends with nature and it is something that takes the appearance to the next level. This actually creates a very pretty and professional finish. Timber cladding can be used to create creative illusions on a wall or used along rugged and rustic materials to form a contrasting appearance.</p><p>The type of timber used can also impact the entire look of the building. The color and appearance of the cladding depend on the species of timber used as well as the different treatments it has gone through. This provides opportunities to create clever designs with various contrasts that utilize the natural characteristics of the timber. There are no particular rules to follow while designing a façade. Building a façade is entirely up to you and it is the real case to showcase the personality of the building.</p><p>Curtain walls and facades are wonderful features that both commercial buildings and homes can adopt. Creating new facades is the best solution to boring designs and standard building structures. Building new facades is an integral part of any building.</p><p>An elegant façade design suddenly changes the characteristics of a build and the way it is perceived. This is one of the secrets behind great designs and can suddenly change the character of a building.</p>",

Such exceptions and elementary observations are influences in Louvre Abu Dhabi. Louvre is the serene combination of light and shadow that creates a welcoming world with reflection and calmness. It belongs to the history and geography of country without becoming a flat translation. It is rather uncommon to find a built archipelago in the sea. It is also protected by a parasol creating a rain of light. It is possibly difficult to access the museum by foot from shore. You could see this museum as the calm as well complex place to reach to. Louvre is a stand out contrast among various museums that cultivate their differences and authenticities. This marvelous museum has the evident shift from tradition to modern proposal. Moreover a major symbol in Arab architecture.</p><p>The double dome which is perfectly radiating in geometry which is a randomly perforated woven material has 180 meters in diameter. The perforated portion provides shade from the bursts of sun. Sight of dome naturally gleams in sunshine. During night it feels like oasis of light under starry dome. Louvre is considered as the final destination of urban promenade. You could feel the shelter of light during the day and evening. This museum is garden on the coast having the most precious works of art in this sanctuary. Jean nouvel sought the inspiration for this concept of Louvre as a museum city in the sea. He is the Pritzker-prize winning architect. Nouvel designed Louvre as a contrasting series of white buildings that take inspiration from medina and low lying Arab settlements. Facades of this beautiful museum city are made up of ultra high performance fibre concrete.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/883157/louvre-abu-dhabi-atelier-jean-nouvel/5a01bfddb22e38b1dc0004e3-louvre-abu-dhabi-atelier-jean-nouvel-photo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><br></a></p>",

It is made of large metal and glass pyramid which is surrounded by three smaller pyramids which were built by I.M.Pie a Chinese-American architect. Louvre re Pyramid is situated in the main courtyard of Louvre Palace. Moreover, the large pyramid serves as the main entrance to Louvre Museum. This museum dates back to the 12th century which was built as a fortress. It was a royal residence before it was a museum. Louvre was the home to several generations of Kings.</p><p>In 1981 Francois Mitterrand the French president launched a campaign to renovate all the cultural institutions in France. One of the prior tasks at that time is the renovation and modification of Louvre. While designing the new Entrance to Louvre Pei’s design featured a system of underground galleries, preservation and storage laboratories as well as a connection between wings of the museum. The addition and relocation of spaces allowed Louvre to expand its collections and place more work on the exhibit. Pie’s design included three smaller triangles which provide light to space below. The pyramids are made of steel and glass. In the 17th century, artists were allowed to stay there and they exchanged ideas, copied paintings, and worked on their own projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Pie wanted the glass of the pyramids to be super clear. So if you peered through it the glass won’t alter their perception of the building color. Most of the glass used In the pyramids was of a greenish tint. Michael Flynn one of the architects from Pie’s group said that finding the perfectly clear glass was a lot of legwork.&nbsp; The glass and steel pyramid located at the center provides a central focal point that makes the appearance of Louvre the best one.&nbsp; The monumental appearance of the large pyramid scale id designed with the same proportions as the Pyramid of Giza.</p>",

		"description" : "<p>Let us see the Facebook offices in Palo Alto. This was designed by Studio O+A which is a San Francisco-based practice that was founded by Primo Orpilla and Verda Alexander in the early 1990s.&nbsp; There are open working areas, several relaxing spaces, meeting rooms here, and there that reflect the spirit of collaboration inside Facebook. The team Facebook recently moved top new headquarters that facilitates interaction and connection between the employees as a part of supporting the company’s mission and vision. Almost 700 employees scattered throughout and around Palo Alto in a 150000 square foot area. As a social networking provider, Facebook needs a laboratory facility with Agile technologies.</p><p>The designers interviewed employees’ opinions about the space they would like and their requirements in the headquarters. And the company weighs the opinion of each employee equally.&nbsp; They conduct company-wide polls on the Facebook platform, about the post-construction photos, designs, and decisions, etc. This keeps everyone informed about the processes behind the project. There works well the mutual collaboration of employees from every department with the designing team to make the venture a great success. Every space planning and final move coordination works in hand likewise.</p><p>The company needs to understand each department’s distinct identity perfectly following the native place of employees. The design takes it as inspiration from the nature of Facebook users and thereby bringing together the distinct elements together to form a cohesive platform and interior spacing that creates neighborhoods within the open-plan space. The major helpful criterion is that executive professional sit in the central areas which is accessible to all employees. Larger areas of lounges and free spaces bring all employees together. Whereas the kitchen and café continue facebook’s tradition of providing meals to all employees at any time while snacks and drinks are available at the micro kitchen that is available throughout the headquarters. Employees are in love with the green headquarters which is the commercial project completed under the 2008 Green Building Ordinance.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the other sustainable features include energy-efficient lighting and recycling content carpet. The use of existing features in architecture making the repurposing industrial components. the design goal was first set up with the maintenance of the history and raw aesthetic of the building. Moreover to create a fun dynamic space for the company’s youthful staff. The majority of the walls and spaces are lefty unfinished and allows the employees to write on the walls, move furniture as their wish allowing the building to evolve continuously.</p>",

Mostly the table-top models or units that could hang on a wall are included in this. It seems to be more than a little novel to have a growing system in your own home. Things had changed a lot across years and fast forward for now. Arranging an indoor vertical farm is not the mainstream concept for now. As more startups and major appliance makers have shown their stunning ideas for the past years, these methodologies are on the way to everyone’s kitchen with splendid ideas.&nbsp; The idea of having a smart farm in your home is not so novel and the majority of people give great thumbs up.</p><p>Your contemplating thoughts on homegrown systems can be made away by knowing about what’s in the pipeline.</p><p>You can have splendid ideas even though you are having minimal space with smart farming systems. The hydroponic devices solve these problems because it’s small and could easily fit on a roof, a countertop even that little space above the refrigerator. Most of the hydroponic devices contain an auto-watering system, a combination of LEDs and sensors that detect humidity, nutrients, air, and other factors that support optimal growth for plants.</p><p>Some types of equipment have apps that manage the growth process and notifies the user when is the time to refill the water tank and harvest plants.&nbsp; The tips and recipes available in the app let you monitor multiple hydroponic devices at the same time. The device is usually available online. Such devices are used in the UK, US, Hong Kong, and Canada. It is in Chicago the IL startup aim in making a plug-in and goes indoor vertical farms. It is easy to assemble a garden with a starter pack of 12 plant pods that can be directly inserted into the grow trays.</p><p>Plant cubes are another versatile idea that headlines by the end of 2019. Plant cubes can automate the temperature, light, climate, and water levels of indoor vertical farms. This appliance looks similar to a wine cooler and is about the same size. The plant cubes are meant to fit in the cupboards or beneath the countertop. The device is available in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxemburg, or the Netherlands.</p><p>On the go, appliances like Plantcubes are possible to be in the home kitchen as common as other kitchen appliances like microwaves. It is ok when the price point comes way down for that to become a reality which is the reason we’re watching plant cubes closely in our futuristic homes.</p>",

The site, lying just 600 meters east of the Arabian Sea, is contextualized around the nearby water. This massive structure is sought to be the biggest structure in india.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">As most of the surrounding buildings are low-rise, the tower’s western facing sightlines are maximized to offer views of the sea.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The visual connection to water was an integral consideration to the development of the building, and is brought to life on the site and in the tower through the addition of water features in public spaces, recreation zones, and even private residences. Nowhere is this theme more apparent than the building’s pool. Facing out from the north façade of the 6th floor, the pool is located in a double-height space and provides one of the widest views of the surrounding area. Its location in the building establishes a direct dialogue with the sea; while the pool itself ends well before the floor’s precipice, a shallow sheet of water extends all the way to the edge of the façade and disappears in an infinity edge meeting the sea beyond.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Along with its proximity to the water, the building’s design is informed by the concept of interconnectivity. On the building’s exterior, the curtain wall was inspired by the idea of a woven fabric. Staggered and segmented vertical metal fins are arranged along the exterior. This pattern is manipulated based on the function of the space within to provide varying degrees of transparency. These elements create a woven motif that unifies the whole complex and integrates it into the city’s cultural context.&nbsp;</span></p>",

Driven by the possibilities laid out in science fiction novels and the desire to prescribe design to solve the problems of their era, the duo.Their solution was the creation of an “anti-design” culture as a means to provide commentary on politics, capitalism, and urbanism, by creating ideas in which everyone is given a functional space that frees itself of time, place, and the need for excessive objects.</p><p>Fast forward to the year 2020, it is the time where the profession has seen a slow resurgence of young, one-off practices devoted to explorations in typology.. These designs, in their own way, pay homage to the influence of SuperStudio and their importance to modern-day discourse.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1971 Natalini said “if design is merely an inducement to consume, then we must reject design...if architecture and town planning is merely the formalization of present unjust social divisions, then we must reject town planning and its cities until all design activities are aimed towards meeting primary needs. Until then, design must disappear. We can live without architecture.” This belief is perhaps best illustrated in SuperStudio’s avant-garde</p>",

		"description" : "<p>Making a comfortable and affordable home is a basic human need, yet millions around the globe lack this basic facility or currently living in dire conditions. 3D printings transform access to housing around the globe.</p><p>Several months and tens of thousands of dollars, that is the approximate terms of time and resources that one must commit to building a home. Over the past decade, this process has changed minimally.&nbsp; The cost of building a home is not a feasible economic outlay for many individuals. This results in over one hundred and fifty million individuals across the globe living in homelessness and one in eight people living in urban slums. On the industrial side, the construction industry faces high accident rates, high costs, declining skilled workers, and low labor efficiency. With the new technology implementation and the rise of 3D printing are discovering ways to lower the time and more importantly the cost of building a home.&nbsp; Moreover in this process significantly has the methodology to reduce the waste and environmental impact that results from the necessary and seemingly home building industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While using the traditional building technique, homes are building as piecemeal with a focus on various parts until each is completed and erected as a whole with specialized labor. This tedious process requires a multitude of skilled laborers and a significant amount of time devoted to modifying and shaping each piece throughout the process. Using the advent of 3D printing and contour crafting has developed a layered fabrication process also known as rapid prototyping allows construction to occur by processing concrete layer by layer until the walls of a home are completed follow the windows and roofs through the traditional construction process. This method reduces the cost of home construction to one-fifth of the traditional cost and slashes the work-completion to a single day. Additive manufacturing has directly impacted product development for home construction in two different ways. First Contour Crafting is able to automatically construct a single house or colony of houses with a single computer set up. Traditionally the set-up time for a home varies drastically by project and requires architectural and engineering skills hiking up labor costs. Second, in traditional home development, manual construction of layers results in uneven surfaces that are later required to be smoothed and finished. The purpose of additive manufacturing allows for the immediate creation of perfectly accurate and results in smooth surfaces which reduce raw materials, labor, and time required for each part of a housing structure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Client’s main requirement was for all spaces to have an experience of the garden. The design revolves around an attempt to create living spaces intermingled with garden spaces. Six different gardens are present within the plot. Five at ground level and one at roof top. The living spaces open out to these gardens from varying orientations giving surprise and delight to the residents walking through.</p><p>Located in a suburb of Colombo, the land is relatively large in urban Sri Lankan standards (1750 sq.m.) and the brief demanded the most to be made out of it.</p><p>The main “texture” and “material” of the design remains the landscape. Plant troughs, gardens, plant beds, turfed areas, red gravel strips and large wines falling down at the front provides the highlights in the material palette at every angle.</p><p>Art has also been used to create focal points in the garden and within the house. A large wall mounted steel mural is the focus of the main garden.

From the outset views and vistas in to the garden and greenery were seen as an important. The concept to embrace the gardens emerged out of this inspiration provided by the client.</p><p>Entering the house from the street one wonders through two garden courtyards before arriving at the main door. Passing a vestibule, one arrives at the main living dining space with double height windows overlooking the side garden and a long grove of tall bamboo plants. This garden runs the full length of the land plot acting as the main garden space while providing a breezy corridor within the property.</p><p>The dining area opens into another courtyard garden with a red gravel floor and a large trough brimming with local “Thebu” plants. The pantry space is finished with a top of the range pantry with a subtle colour scheme while opening in to the main garden. </p><p>The main visual feature of the design is the first floor roof garden which is defined into the built form through a steel grille structure. There are varying visual connections provided in to this garden from the stair way, front bedroom and the study at second floor.</p><p>The Wet kitchen has direct access from the garage and visual connection into the courtyard. Four bedrooms, a study and a rooftop garden completes the design.</p><p>Photography : Eresh Weerasuriya &amp; Madhushan de Silva</p><p>Project Team &amp; suppliers</p><p>Architects  : KWA Architects / Chamika Darshini, Champika Amarasena, Praneeth Dilan, </p><p>   Thilan Koththigoda</p><p>Structural Engineer  : Priyantha Pushpa Kumara</p><p>MEP Engineer  : Chandana Wanaguru</p><p>Cost Consultant  : Hasitha Gunasekara</p><p>Main contractor  : Buddhika Dharmasiri</p><p>Aluminium Windows : Alro (pvt) Ltd</p><p>Interior Contractors : Teak Spa, </p><p>Landscape contractor : Nishantha – Beauty Garden Service</p><p>Pantry : Lanka Cucine</p><p>Toilet fittings : Rocell</p><p>Taps &amp; accessories : Hansgrohe by Access</p><p>Blinds  : Light &amp; Shade</p><p>…</p><p>#architecture #archdaily #architecturephotography #architecture_hunter #architecturedesign #residentialdesign #architecturelovers #modernhomes #tropicalarchitecture #architecturedesign #houses #tropicalhouse</p>",

		"title" : "Advanced Technologies for the Great leap in Architecture industry",
		"description" : "<p><strong>Role of technology in architecture</strong></p><p>Technology has now become an unavoidable factor in Architectural firms. Since technology paves the way for the advanced architectural experience. Beginning with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.arclif.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Arclif</a>.com, we have technology with all its colors that enhance the way we design buildings. The craft behind&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.arclif.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Arclif</a>.com&nbsp;will never stop evolving since we are looking for a massive change in the architecture industry for the coming years.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Virtual Reality</h2><p>Virtual reality puts you in a state of immense change in architectural works and puts you in an alternate scenario that makes everything easier. It has now become an important methodology for designers and architects to display everything as simple as displaying video games or interactive short films. At every stage of the building process beginning from initial design concept to final finishing touches, virtual reality lends you to a powerful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.arclif.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">architectural</a>&nbsp;experience.</p><p>With just the press of a button, everything regarding the process of building is comprehensible. Considering every project member to a client, everyone can explore the building in question and take a closer look at the floor, ceilings, building designs to a closer vision. This gives plenty of room for discussions and requests for changes or suggests needed alterations before the product starts. Virtual reality not only makes the project sparking interest in it more than a classic 2D image cloud.</p><p>Moreover, Virtual reality can give you a competitive edge that allows real-time changes and reap the rewards of an impressed client.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>The Internet of Things</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Internet of things allows connecting the traditionally dumb things to the internet. House owners normally have some technology connected to the IoT. Examples of IoT range from smart thermostats, video doorbells to personal assistants like Alexa which are already common in many homes. And now IoT has a variety of trends in the construction ecosystem. Here are the few steps commonly used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building Information Modeling attached with sensors</p><p>Building plans are well streamlined and create an intelligent 3D model of a building using BIM. This allows all plans to update simultaneously so nobody in the process is left out. The usage of sensors in the building is to measure things such as energy usage, foot traffic, temperature trends, and more. These data collected by sensors can be studied and improve future buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making the world a greener place</p><p>Buildings are the places where CO2 emissions are commonly seen. The percentage of CO2 emissions outstrips both the transportation and industrial sectors of the society. So finding ways to make our buildings greener is a must. Designing a building with IoT in mind can help us in a variety of ways by reducing wastes by not needing humans to turn off machines and HVAC systems, which is having more impact on energy consumption. And with the IoT, we can monitor our buildings more closely than before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Transforming Pre-fabrication</p><p>With the invention of RFID technology that gains more popularity, we are going to see prefabrication becomes more popular again. It is possible to prepare for a prefab revolution beyond consumer housing. This will be beneficial to design and this will undoubtedly reduce construction waste.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>3D Printing</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;To create the physical model to showcase the imaginary structure, architects and designers use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arclif.com/post/799\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">3D printing</a>&nbsp;as an efficient practice. You only need a CAD program and a 3D printer to do 3D printing. In ancient days it is normally modeled by hand, whereas now it is easier to do by saving labor and time. Advanced printing technology is a boon that creates high-quality models and you can customize it with a range of materials and colors. It is simple to do quick fixes with this. If a team or client has any edits after reviewing, it is possible to do quick fixes using programming software and reprint the model.</p><p>The above-mentioned technologies are changing the field of architecture from producing immersive visualization to streamlining communication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Advantages of including Technology in Architecture</strong></p><p>There are many advantages while using these advanced technologies in architecture to strengthen and support architectural design. As technology develops continually, it allows us to think more creatively and bring those visions from mind to 3D print. Some of the unavoidable advantages are listed below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The decrease in Project cost: It is difficult to change the model after the construction starts. So by using virtual reality or 3D printing it is possible to identify the area that needs change. When you identify the changes, it is more convenient and reduces the cost for everybody involved.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Communicate vision easily:</strong>&nbsp;Clients and buyers can slip into virtual reality and see building plans unfolding, or touch a 3D print of their new home. This interactive experience helps connect people to the finished product like never before.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Streamline collaboration:</strong>&nbsp;Technology advancements such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) helps everybody involved in a project stay on the same page at every step. Engineers, designers, and architects can use a BIM program to ensure their specific plans are in alignment before any cutting or welding takes place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ready for the change in Architecture with advanced technologies?</strong></p><p>Many of the foundations of this great profession are not going to change even though technology in architecture plays a major role. Feel free to reach us at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.arclif.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">arclif.com</a>&nbsp;to explore the new world of architecture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

		"description" : "<p>Warka Water and Arturo Vittori Create Integrated Village for the Rainforest Community in Cameroon</p><p>Under construction in the tropical rainforest of Cameroon, Warka Village is an integrated space for the Pygmy community, an isolated society located in the Mvoumagomi area. Constructed using only natural materials and ancient local construction techniques, the project, created by Warka Water and Italian architect Arturo Vittori, is currently operational, and expected to be completed in 2022.</p><p>Situated in Mvoumagomi, about 40 km from Kribi in the south region of Cameroon, the Warka village is destined for the Pygmy community, a gathering of villagers who live in groups of 30 people on average, 100 people at most. Deep in the tropical rainforest, this community is often cut off from nearby towns because of dangers from flooding.</p><p>Using material like earth, water, stone, wood, and natural fibers, “the Warka village aspires to transform the landscape of comprehensive human development, utilizing low-cost, sustainable, community-driven, high-impact multi-sector development interventions that are tailored to the village’s specific needs”. An example of how to live with nature, the village encompasses different Warka interventions. It will generate 7 bamboo Warka houses, 2 Warka towers to collect around 40 to 80 liters every day of drinking water from the air, no flushing Warka sanitation systems using composting toilets, a Warka garden to harvest food and a Warka pavilion.</p><p>With already 30 individuals living and working on the premises, the village is taking shape, addressing the daily needs of the villagers. Ensuring rural infrastructure, agriculture, health, water, and sanitation, the project, under construction for the past 18 months, seeks to provide essential living services. In fact, protecting the community is protecting the rainforest, according to Arturo Vittori.</p><p>Warka Water is a nonprofit focused on innovative and sustainable solutions to some of humanity’s most enduring issues through the fusion of local knowledge and resources, visionary design, and ancient traditions. Founded by Italian architect Arturo Vittorio, this organization aims to bring “potable water, and proper sanitation and hygiene to some of the world’s most isolated communities”.</p><p>Using ancient knowhow, Warka Tower, the first pilot project of the organization, allows people to harvest water from the sky. This sustainable approach was first installed in Ethiopia in early 2015. “It is a passive structure, it functions only by natural phenomena such as gravity, condensation &amp; evaporation. It is conceived to be owned and operated autonomously by the villagers. The design is not universal but it depends on the local meteorological conditions, the geomorphological characteristic of the site, and the local culture”.</p><p>Shortly after, the non-profit realized that similar issues were unfortunately present in other communities in different geographical areas. Currently active in Cameroon where they are constructing the Warka Village, the team is also undertaking the first steps to bring help to different isolated communities in places such as Haiti, Togo, and Colombia.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/946669/warka-water-and-arturo-vittori-create-integrated-village-for-the-rainforest-community-in-cameroon?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.archdaily.com/946669</a></p>",

		"description" : "<p>AMKNA's Ode to Africa Shortlisted for the 2018 World Architecture Festival Award</p><p>    Written by Dima Stouhi</p><p>    July 21, 2018</p><p>AMKNA, the Dubai-based studio, has been shortlisted for the 2018 World Architecture Festival, in recognition of their design proposal of a cultural center in Sedhiou, Senegal. The proposed “Sedhiou Cultural Center” will provide citizens with a rich cultural, social, and educational experience, all while sustaining the surrounding environment and keeping African heritage alive.</p><p>The power of a cultural building lies in its ability to morph history, music, food, dance, color, and material into a well-designed, functional space. Senegal’s Sedhiou is one of Africa’s underdeveloped towns but is rich in cultural vibrancy. Regardless of its lively heritage, the town lacks a place of artistic expression and is constantly affected by the economy’s globalization. The proposal’s design seeks to become an icon for the entire country, ensuring sustainability and the use of local materials. The structure will include areas for education, exhibition, performances, bureaus, and restrooms, catering to everyone in the country.</p><p>AMKNA’s design tells centuries-old stories of Africa. Sedhiou inhibits approximately 22,000 citizens and has been affected by the Casamance conflict during 1980 – 2005. The Casamance River was crucial for transporting natural resources, such as Kapok, Palm, and Fromager trees, from Sedhiou to neighboring towns, but the ongoing war took its toll on the city’s trade movements, affecting its economy. Even though Senegal is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the country suffers from a devastating water crisis, killing millions of people yearly.</p><p>Naturally, drought is very apparent on the land as it creates cracks on the ground’s surface. Instead of submitting to these constraints, the architects decided to use the land’s imperfections and derive the structure’s concept from the cracks’ forms and the land’s excessive need for water. The roof of the building is split into inwardly-inclined platforms so that people can benefit from the rainwater harvesting. In addition, the plan was intricately designed in a way that allows natural winds to travel through the building via vents (cracks) on the facades, creating cross-ventilation within the space. The structure will house reading rooms, musical areas, craft workshops, and outdoor activities.</p><p>Since it was vital to make use of the existing natural resources, the architects chose to use a clay/mud hybrid for the project’s structure, as it is traditionally used in the construction of housing in Senegal. The architects also chose to use bamboo, wooden beams, traditional plaster, and plenty of vibrant hues of blue, red, green, and gold to keep the traditions of Africa alive.</p><p>    “The intervention area represents a breeding ground of centuries-old cultures, rich in rituals and experiences coming from father to son, and telling stories about Africa. Cultures here are mixing together in harmony, within an environment full of experiences. Some of those ethnic groups are deeply rooted in history, and, since they never had any archives or written works, they passed those stories only thanks to words coming from the Elders.”</p><p>    -AMKNA designers</p><p></p>",

The objective was to fulfil the idea of the client to have a house which is “unique” by adding elements of <em>nostalgic-traditional Kerala style</em> of architecture. We worked upon creating spaces inside house for the residents to sit as a family, which include the living room and dining, looking to the green courtyard, where they can perceive the feel of their childhood memories of their home. The courtyard act as the focal point of the house. The design enables view from every common space and the master bedroom to the courtyard. Hence, the courtyard brings in the idea of “nature inside the home “in which we can experience the beauty of sunlight, shadows and the rain making it eco-friendly. There are other spaces like the bedroom with balconies of the upper floor that open to the enthralling picturesque of the flowing river. Even when the house has traditional components like sloping roof, rustic interiors, there are components of contemporary style like a cuboidal façade infused to the design to make it interesting.</p>",

		"description" : "<p>'MADANG.zip' is a tiny house for young couple in Korea.</p><p>In Korean, ‘Madang’ means a yard and is a unit for counting an episode of pansori, a traditional Korean song. In addition, ‘Zip(Jip)’ means a house, so &lt;MADANG.zip&gt; means to compress the stories of young couple living in this house.</p><p>Korea has a densely populated capital. Young couples prefer areas to live where they can easily commute to work and also prefer apartments that are convenient to live and have privacy. However, Seoul’s housing price is so high that it is difficult to own a house at a young age. Recently, small houses have been chosen as a substitute for apartments. Unlike people in other countries who pursue a minimalist lifestyle, Koreans prefer a spacious house, but they can’t choose one, so they choose a small house. Therefore, small but convenient housing is required to accommodate their way of life.</p><p>Theres are 3 factors that are environmentally friendly. First, the courtyard creates a wind way for ventilation that causes air convection. The air heated on the asphalt from outside road rises, and the cold air in the shaded garden under the bedroom descends, circulating the air. Secondly, solar collectors are installed to heat the water used for floor heating. Third, rainwater is also collected to be used for floor heating and household water. These factors can significantly save young couples the cost of maintaining their home.</p><p>The various elevation created in response to the slopes forms a step and visually separates each space.

The construction of the Centre for Earth Architecture accomplishes the activities of the AKTC in Mopti after the restoration of the mosque and the construction of a new sewerage system. The construction site has been gained by a backfill at the waterside of an interior lake and so the lakeside has been made accessible for public use. The program itself responds both to the needs of the district management Komoguel as to the visitors of the cultural facilities of the district.</p><p>From the crest of the dike the construction site and therefore also the building project are in one sight axis together with the mosque. The building is clearly structured and its building height responds to the existing fabric without compromising the view on the mosque. The visitor centre, according to its program is divided into three different buildings which are connected by two roof surfaces. All the walls and the barrel vaults are constructed of BTC (compressed earth blocks) which are very suitable to the climatic conditions for their natural temperature buffer and therefore guarantee comfortable indoor temperatures. The overhanging roof blocks the insulation on the walls and provides qualitative outdoor spaces. Ventilation openings in the walls and the vaults provide a natural flow of air so that the building conditioning works without mechanic backing. The landscape project includes wide public spaces and a promenade on top of the dike. The project for the new building responds to this initial planning as it keeps adjacent to the dike.</p><p>Text provided by Kere Architecture.</p><p></p>",

Consisting of four circular zones. The outdoor spaces between the huts create communal areas to separate the huts from the busy streets cape and also as a place for social interactions functions as an open community center for gathering local community under connected thatched roof mesh designed to be an iconic structure that is respecting Sedhiou’s skyline harmony, and its contemporary curves and lines shine under the west African sun.</p><p>The building shows new innovative use of local materials, replacing the concrete walls with locally made compressed earth blocks, coupled with wide overhanging thatched dome that is designed to be capable of collecting domestic water usage in fresh rainfall. The openings in the thatched roof allow passive air circulation to cool the building and light to pass through the space and interactive patterns on the walls. The people of Sedhiou can participate in the construction activities by building their stories with their hands, and next generations also have the opportunity to add their stories on the walls where the walls are built to be timeless. The building will leave a wide social impact, hoping for a revival for their architecture history.</p><p></p>",

		"description" : "<p>Diana Kellogg, the New York-based architect bridges the gaps of geography, culture and language to build a school for girls in the mystic deserts of Jaisalmer. The building in made in sandstone and is in a huge eclipse shape. The eclipse is layered one over the another and enhanced with jalis which create spectacular views and shadows. With the material and the shape of the building itself, it is really blending with the natural landscape. Sometimes it feels like a huge alien vessel kept in the middle of the Thar desert. In other words, a feminine approach is also visible in the entire design.</p><p>The building cluster consists of three complex- the school building, women's cooperative exhibition cum performance hall and a textile museum. CITTA initiated the project and is located in Kanoi village of Jaisalmer , on 35600 square meters of land. The schools is from kindergarten to class ten for about 400 girls.</p><p>The interior curve of the courtyard at the Rajkumari Ratnavati Girls School in Jaisalmer. The courtyard acts as a water-harvesting facility with a cistern in the middle. The rare fruit trees were preserved within the oval with steps around for the girls to play and sit in the shade. The whole structure is covered with solar canopy which makes it more sustainable. The staircase which leads to the terraced solar canopy is covered with jali works.</p><p>SOCIAL RELEVANCE</p><p>The state Rajasthan has got the state’s worst female literacy rates. This school has an aim to educate girl child and thus to fight against child marriage, infant mortality and other gender stereotypes. Designer herself says that the oval form of the structure reflects the universal symbol of feminine strength. Last but not least, the school uniforms are designed by celebrity costume designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee himself using the Ajrakh print understanding the relevance of the project.</p><p>This school is perfect the example of architecture becoming an answer to the social and cultural issues existing in the society without disturbing the natural landscape.</p><p><em>Photo Courtesy : Vinay Panjwani</em></p><p></p><p></p>",

		"title" : "HOUSE OF  EARTHY HUES BY URBAN IVY",
		"description" : "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>House of earthy hues is designed over two paradoxical ideas: A tropical face which blends in with the lush green paddy field on the rear side and the second one standing out with a modern façade complementing the su-urban context of Aluva. This 2500 sq.ft eco-friendly residence is designed in a tropical site responsive method exploring all the advantages of the adjoining paddy field and is in perfect harmony with nature.</p><p><strong>The thought behind</strong></p><p>As the name refers, ‘House of Earthy Hues’ – adapts the colour palette from what is around the house. It breaths in the outside inside. The house is an exploration of how spaces can be defined with a framed view of the paddy. The design also emphasizes on an open planning with free-flowing spaces and internal connectivity providing interactive spaces to overcome the limitations of a linear footprint.</p><p><strong>Spatial Configuration</strong></p><p>The house has been designed with 2 bedrooms, a spacious living, dining area including an internal courtyard and pantry space in the ground floor and 2 other bedrooms including master bedroom with a private courtyard, and a family living space with an extended spacious deck area. The kitchen has been planned facing the open paddy field, where ample airflow and natural light is guaranteed, considering kitchen as the most used space in the house. The connections to the outside are constant, in the form of small and large openings, semi-open decks and sheltered balconies.</p><p>The massing of the house has been deliberately planned differentiating the common and the private areas. Ceiling volumes and textures were used to create zones in the whole structure. An attempt in breaking the closeness vertically was successful as the spaces feel connected from all levels. The internal connection is increased by connecting floors through all the open areas which is spread around the plan creating the feeling of whole house as one.&nbsp; Although the site had its own linear footprint and limitations, the movement pattern of the house starts and ends with open spaces in all directions.</p><p><strong>The material palette</strong></p><p>Utilizing the vast field in the rear side was one of the major decisions while designing this house. The major challenge was to bring the green paddy fields to inside while providing privacy for all the bedrooms. Also, bringing in maximum daylight and wind from the open fields was another strategy. This was sorted by providing large openings towards the paddy field along with a large balcony with automatic rolling perforated shutters. In the day time ample wind and light is entered through all openings, while at night the rolling shutters can be closed and locked providing privacy and safety for the clients, while wind comes in through the perforations. Stack effect is also provided inside the house to the hot air escape making the house cooler even during the summer season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Design Highlights</strong></p><p>The major feature of the house being the slanted exposed brick wall, designed to stand out from the context but yet giving the tropical touch to the residence that merges with the background.</p><p>The design has also attempted in bringing nature inside, both with the use of contextually detailed skylights and the <strong>jaali</strong> which is the breezeway that facilitates natural cooling of the interiors, complemented with a distribution of internal gardens and pools this works together to bring in a magical play of light.</p><p>&nbsp;As the name suggests the ‘House of earthy Hues' adapts not only the pallet but the whole essence of Earth, making this house much more than a mere building. Spaces created with almost details and delicacy to take in the desirable weather and making each corner a usable and enjoyable space resulting in a happy family time in the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Master brains</strong></p><p>Started by a group of young architects and urban planners, Urbane ivy is the result of the long evening conversations on designs and details of by close friends. Out motto is representing togetherness and growth hand in hand in creating aesthetic, functional and green patched living spaces. Driven towards passion towards architecture and being in this journey together, we take inspirations from nature and believes there lies all the answers for our curious questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Fact file&nbsp;</strong></u></p><p>Project name: House of Earthy hues</p><p>Design firm: Urbane ivy</p><p>Area (in sq ft): 2500</p><p>Location: Aluva, Ernakulam, Kerala</p><p>Principal architects: Vishnu AR, Nancy Mary Ann K,&nbsp; Nikhil AS, Anand Raveendran</p><p>Client: Mr. Rehanesh, Mrs.Neethu</p><p>Photography (studio name and IG handle):&nbsp; Out of Focus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Postal address of the design firm:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Email ids:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>urbaneivy@gmail.com</p><p><strong>Website url:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://urbaneivy-6f84a.web.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://urbaneivy-6f84a.web.app/</a></p>",

		"description" : "<p>Roofs are not just roots these days. Here are some of the innovative rooftop ideas which can be adapted in the new era.</p><p><strong>ROOF GARDENS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Roof gardens are used widely around the globe for several years, especially among the city dwellers who don’t have enough space for an outdoor garden space. The easiest way for roof gardening is using containers and planter boxes on the roof as they are more elegant, flexible and light weight. Many other options like inbuilt gardening and urban farming are also trending these days. Rooftop gardens ensure the&nbsp;maximum&nbsp;usage of unused space, beatify the space, provide privacy and environment friendly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ROOFTOP POOLS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Rooftop pools are made if there is any space constrains in the site or for aesthetic purpose. These pools are built over the roof slab with proper waterproofing and spectacular views. The shape of the pool must be considered before building the rooftop pools. These are commonly used in commercial and hospitality buildings as it’s a sign of luxury and comfort.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A PLACE FOR INNOVATIVE ACTIVITIES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Many fun activities could be planned as a part of rooftop designs. In this urbanized world having a private space for leisure activities will be a boon. Rooftops are identified as such a space.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ROOFTOP PLAYGROUND</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Rooftop playground is an emerging idea and a need of the new era. It promotes usage of unused space on the public buildings. This&nbsp;ensures&nbsp;the livability of a city and the city dwellers.&nbsp;Spatial&nbsp;considerations must be done over the safety aspects.&nbsp;</p><p>Picture Courtesy : <em>Hiroyuki Oki, Studio Bauhaus, Park n Play / JAJA Architects</em></p><p></p>",

In this architecture, the earth appearing as a free form according to light, wind, surrounding environment and function is stacked and the interior space is arranged as an exchangeable attachment in any layer. There is space for the external environment to be established in all the earth’s layers, and various relationship between inside and outside is spun. The stacked ground layer overlaps as “sky topography” when looking up, and changes the quality of the lower space. The ground of each layer is stacked as the concrete topography that appeared as a form to deliver wind and light as a curve that avoids the airspace expected to grow trees in trees and trees in the garden. To realize this concept, the architects devised a structure system that three-dimensional branch found in natural trees can support the stacked ground. A steel pipe like this folded branch can follow the stacking of the free shape topography. Also, that is also a pipe space, and the attachment which becomes the internal space arranged in the ground can be freely renewed.</p><p>Credits : <a href=\"https://leibal.com/architecture/earth-house/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://leibal.com/architecture/earth-house/</a></p>",

		"description" : "<p>The filler slab is based on the principle that for roofs which are simply supported, the upper part of the slab is subjected to compressive forces and the lower part of the slab experience tensile forces. Concrete is very good in withstanding compressive forces and steel bears the load due to tensile forces. Thus the lower tensile region of the slab does not need any concrete except for holding the steel reinforcements together.</p><p>Therefore in a conventional RCC slab lot of concrete is wasted and it needs extra reinforcement due to added load of the concrete which can otherwise be replaced by low-cost and light weight filler materials, which will reduce the dead weight as well as the cost of the slab to 25% (as 40% less steel is used and 30% less concrete).</p><p>The simplest filler is to use two fifth grade Mangalore tiles, that is what is used in our projects, they do not have any structural value- they are mere ‘fillers’. The different materials that can alternatively be used are waste and cheap like Country tile, Earthen pots, Hollow blocks, Coconut shells, Thermocol, etc. Besides the roof this technique can also be used for the window sun-shades.</p><p>MATERIALS USED</p><ul><li><p>Bricks</p></li><li><p>Tiles</p></li><li><p>Cellular</p></li><li><p>Concrete</p></li><li><p>Blocks</p></li><li><p>Pots</p></li><li><p>Waste bottles.</p></li></ul><p>Credits : Architecture and development</p><p></p>",

		"description" : "<p><br>The design of Heydar Aliyev Center establishes a continuous, fluid relationship between its surrounding plaza and the building’s interior. The plaza, as the ground surface; accessible to all as part of Baku’s urban fabric, rises to envelop an equally public interior space and define a sequence of event spaces dedicated to the collective celebration of contemporary and traditional Azeri culture.</p><p>the complex structure forms an integral part of the baku city .Elaborate forms, including undulations, bifurcations, folds, and inflections modify this plaza surface into an architectural landscape that performs a multitude of functions: welcoming, embracing, and directing visitors through different levels of the interior.  this provides great ambience for the visitors .In this way, the building blurs the conventional differentiation between architectural object and urban landscape, building envelope and urban plaza, figure and ground, interior and exterior.<br>The Heydar Aliyev Center is a national symbol for Azerbaijan, a catalyst for regeneration and, in the broadest sense, a regional showpiece. Constructing Zaha Hadid Architects’ audacious design for the Center drew on expertise from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as further afield. This explains the feel-good factor and can-do mentality, which made it possible. It was a labor of love and one that clearly paid off, given that it was named Design of the Year 2014 by the London Design Museum - a first for an architectural project.<br>It is in the design of the auditorium that Zaha Hadid Architects’ approach can be seen at its most formalistic, and its swirling free-form geometry in American white oak was one of the practice’s principal challenges to the project team. For specialist Ankara-based contractor, İkoor, who were responsible for the construction of the auditorium, free-form meant anything but a free-for-all. The architects expected the outcome of their design exploration to be replicated to the letter, providing little scope for rationalization and no possibility of “design creep.” The forms of the auditorium, appearing to metamorphose in algorithmic sequence from one bay to the next, could not be reduced to repetitive modules.<br>At the outset, İkoor were unsure how to proceed, evaluating the alternatives of a five-axle CNC router-milled solid wood shell, 45 mm thick for optimum acoustic performance, and a timber-clad carcass. They also considered CNC router-shaped polystyrene, strengthened with fiberglass and veneered with timber. Concerned about accuracy, unsatisfactory wood grain patterns, expansion and contraction, İkoor rejected these options for a fourth they called “engineered craftsmanship”, that involved working with Rhino software to accurately construct a carcass from horizontal and vertical MDF members.<br>These members were CNC-formed, so they could be assembled to form a shape, which is a precise offset of the finished surface as modeled by Zaha Hadid Architects. Next, this surface was covered with four layers of accurately dimensioned 10 mm x 10 mm American white oak strips, successively glued, nailed, worked, and adjusted until they precisely matched the geometry modeled by the architect, checked with digitally generated templates. This was the crafted stage of the operation. Each bay of the auditorium comprises three sections, one for the ceiling and two for its flanking walls, assembled from 8 to 15 subcomponents.<br>Such was the scale of the construction project that, overall, 230 cubic meters of American white oak were used in the auditorium. Melih Gün, co-founder and owner of İkoor says that American white oak was chosen for the principal reasons that it “would perform well in an application where temperature and humidity levels would vary, it is homogeneous in texture with the right color for the desired end result, it has good working properties and, especially important for this project, its has good acoustic performance.”<br>Ikoor was not only the contractor of this project, but also was responsible for the acoustics and coordination tasks related to the auditorium. The company worked together with Dr. Mehmet Çalışkan from Mezzo Stüdyo Acoustic Consulting, also from Ankara.<br>For acoustic reasons, the internal surfaces were constructed as a shell within a box. Once this box was constructed, the internal shell was attached to a secondary steel frame, with rubber pad connections to the internal faces of its structure. An intermediary shell of multilayered sound insulation and steel wire suspension cables provide further acoustic isolation. Although this wasn’t a routine operation for the project team, its greatest challenge was the auditorium’s roof acoustics. This challenge was partly inherent in the project’s brief, requiring a space for conferences, which need low reverberance, so speech can be heard clearly, and music, which benefits from more reflection and richer acoustics.<br>The proposed use of the auditorium for opera and ballet as well as concerts was an additional complication, because each requires a different configuration of orchestra shell and pit. Zaha Hadid Architects’ prescriptive geometry, choice of reflective surface finishes and unwillingness to entertain acoustic enhancements that would transform the appearance of the auditorium according to its use, wound up the ratchet still further. This wasn’t just an acoustic form-finding exercise.<br>Mezzo Stüdyo, no stranger to headstrong architects’ visions for auditoria or conflicting requirements in clients’ briefs, was unfazed and, like other project team members, accepted Zaha Hadid Architects’ detailed proposals as a given. Mezzo Stüdyo also knew a deus ex machina was to hand: coupled-volume room acoustics. This involves two or more spaces joined by a common acoustically transparent surface, known as a coupling aperture. The core concept relies on unequal time requirements for sound decay in each space. This entails excess energy in one space during the decay process, which is transferred to the other. This can produce a sound decay that is suitable for the desired acoustic qualities within a space.<br>In the case of the Heydar Aliyev Center, an unused ceiling void adjacent to the proscenium opening provided an opportunity to construct an enclosure with reflecting surfaces to act as the coupling volume. The configuration of flaps opening into this space was optimized through acoustic simulations involving 8,751 plane surfaces derived from Zaha Hadid Architects’ model, using ODEON software. This configuration of multiple apertures provides a better diffusion and flow of surplus energy from the coupled room into the main hall than would be achieved with one large opening.<br></p>",

		"description" : "<p>_Architecture and Fragrance, both have the ability to enhance the human emotions. In a culture dominated by the technologically mediated information, fragrance provides a subtle counterpoint. Smell is one of the five senses which is rarely investigated due to the lack of language for expression. This thesis is aimed to explore the relation between the Fragrance and Architecture, ultimately designing an International perfume museum and Fragrance park, a collaborative space for the perfumers to exhibit their Art of Scent. Designing with non-visual attributes challenges ways of representation. Which the thesis has tried to resolve.</p><p>_Primarily the scent-based artworks face a variety of challenges for their exhibition and recognition on the art market. The site at Kannauj- The Perfume capital of India, offered tremendous opportunities to explore more on the topic. The economic profile of Kannauj rely on the Perfume industries and its by products like Agarbatties and other aroma products. The glory of this city is now diminishing, due to lack of awareness among the tourists and public. In an attempt to preserve the same, the project includes a Museum, Research block and a Manufacturing block as the main components. Being the first ever proposed Smell Sensorymuseum in Asia Pacific, the project faced several limitations. Hence the case studies were limited to common sensory museums and Research institutions in agricultural field.</p><p>_The project was carried out through multiple stages beginning from the site study and analysis, finally arriving at a design solution. The design was evolved from the concept to stimulate the emotional characteristics of human being by sensing the smell. The exhibition spaces were carefully designed pertaining to the relevant standards obtained from background study and data collection. The design purpose was not just to exhibit the perfumes, but also to intentionally trigger the forgotten memory of people with the amalgamation of the Architecture and Fragrance. Bioclimatic Architecture was integrated into the design in order to make it more fruitful. </p>",

		"description" : "<p><em>“Bridges are metaphors for everything in life, … The bridge is not just about getting back and forth between north and south. The bridge is about connecting our communities.”</em></p><p><em>- Jim West</em></p><p>Modern city design principles cater to an automobile-centric city in which the pedestrian network and connections are neglected, failing to create pedestrian-friendly spaces. This notion is evident in the waning effort by the Sabarmati Riverfront Development project in Ahmedabad, which aims at stitching together a city divided by a river using a series of vehicular bridges. Such a problem can’t be met with generic solutions; it calls for unique ideas. This project aims at addressing this problem by developing an alternate, efficient and distinct solution for this through the idea of habitable bridges and to create a City Centre for Ahmedabad in terms of cultural, social and commercial activity.</p><p>Habitable bridge means a bridge with permanent habitable structures over its span. (The habitable structures can be residential, commercial, public or cultural) The history, principles, feasibility etc. of such structures are explored within the framework of the thesis.</p><p>This thesis identifies and explores the challenges and opportunities of such a project to design an architectural solution for bridging communities. The project focuses on extending the urban fabric across the Sabarmati river connecting the pedestrian and vehicular traffic and to force this structure to act as an activity generator rather than just a transit medium. Within the framework of the thesis, it also delves into modular architecture to explore efficient construction, structural and expansion techniques. The project aims at creating a structure that simulates the various experiences of city life across the river to successfully bridge the urban fabric.</p><p>Presumably such a project of extreme expense and resources may seem like a farfetched fantasy than a feasible solution. But the recent proposal for such a Habitable Bridge across the Musi river in Hyderabad to cater the commercial needs suggests that India can handle such a concept.</p>",

		"description" : "<p><strong>Reviving Lost Lands: Story of land degradation</strong></p><p>Reviving lost lands is an attempt to look into the severe issue of land degradation across the globe. The project identifies 'Banni grasslands' as its pilot for land regeneration. The Banni Grassland has a complex ecological history. The introduced alien tree Prosopis Julifora is quickly taking over large tracts of open grasslands of Banni with not just ecological but also social ramifications. Pushed towards a sedentary lifestyle, pastoralists of the region are taking up agriculture to make their ends meet.</p><p>The project acts in two entities, one centralized and other decentralized. The centralized part acts as the center to educate and train people to work in the field of regeneration and make a livelihood out of it. Regeneration of land is a water dependent process and the regions with high percentage of land degradation face acute resource shortage (water, electricity, food, etc.) accelerated due to human activities, thus it becomes very important to harvest these energies and reuse the waste in whatever form possible. The centralized center works on this principle on minimizing energy dependency. The decentralized systems are the ones which are deployed the entire region, which help in harvesting the energy required for land regeneration which include water harvesting units, greenhouses etc.</p>",

		"description" : "<p>Lakshadweep is a union territory of India which is located in south western part of Arabian sea known for its undiscovered beauty on corals, lagoons, coconut land and so on. Lakshadweep consist of 36 islands of its only 10 are inhabited and left 26 are uninhabited, they are treated as an islands for tourism development. Central government have put forward proposals on resorts in each islands including tourism like Maldives to develop tourism of Lakshadweep by considering limitations on availability of bed capacity for tourists.</p><p>But all these proposals are not feasible by the way they approached. These proposals will affect the marine life by disturbing their breeding locations and their habitats. Not only, the construction approach will disturb the coral frame structure of islands. Already the corals of Lakshadweep are dying due to global warming. So the corals are not able to perform their function as natural wave barrier. All these leads to erosion of soft beds of lagoons. As a result the island which have only altitude 2 m height will slowly disappear due to coastal erosion.</p><p>So I choose a Floatation approach to develop tourism infrastructure without disturbing the islands. Already islands have limitations such as electricity, water availability, transportation, etc. Most of the limitations can be solved through floatation technology. By Floatation method we can transfer a structure from one place to another on our demands. So the Floatation method is environmentally feasible comparing the existing government proposals. I had included coral restoration technology by which we can restore the dead corals. Through this we can prevent the island from coastal erosion to a limit.</p><p>For my case studies, I had selected 3 type of resorts (Maldivian resort, Floating resort, Normal resort) and floating structures. From my studies I am aware that Floating approach is more sufficient in which region lacks land availability. So here I am concluding that floatation approach is more sufficient and environment friendly. By this technology we can protect the future marine ecosystem, islands, economy, etc. Floatation approach also helps to minimize the surface temperature created due to global warming.</p>",

This web of communication and finance now not only remains to these sectors but now grows into the data, goods, transport and knowledge sectors as well. Architecture here takes a step back; first the policies and services are resolved and then to facilitate the infrastructure comes in. This I call the Social Infrastructure. This project proposes social infra­structure at every level, every scale of the Postal Network; thus, creating part to whole and whole to part inter-dependencies between the man, the built and the technology of today's world.

		"description" : "<h2><strong>What Is the Purpose of a Courtyard?</strong></h2><p>In modern architectural design, courtyards have several purposes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Invites natural light</strong>. Natural light is one of the best ways to make a space feel larger, open, and inviting—and courtyards are bright open areas designed to invite sunlight, which can rejuvenate humans and plants alike. Internal gardens are a common feature in open courtyards—the bright space is a perfect location for sun-loving trees and plants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encourages air movement</strong>. As open-air spaces, courtyards allow breezes to enter the building during hot summers. For this reason, courtyards are especially popular in warmer climates, where breezes help keep the house cool during the summer, but the residents don’t need to worry about snow in the winter. Courtyards also offer a way to invite airflow without the security concerns of leaving windows or doors open.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creates a relaxing space</strong>. Whether you’re at home or in an office, being stuck inside for long periods can be stressful. Courtyards offer a solution by creating a beautiful, private outdoor space that you can use to get some fresh air, talk to a neighbor, or even meditate. Courtyards are a prominent feature for many colleges and office buildings, giving workers and students a relaxing space to eat lunch, study, or chat with friends and co-workers on their daily breaks.</p></li></ul><h2></h2>",

The space in which you live deeply influences your quality of life; so it’s important you make sure you inhabit a good space.”  ~Roberto Tripi</em></u></p><p>All through history, Architecture has stood as a representation of society, reflecting the values, victories, and possible destruction of civilizations over time. From the momentous structures to the homes and buildings that make up the texture of a city, able to learn a part around who the individuals were who occupied them long some time recently our time. By considering the built environment of the past, combined with modern-day investigate on brain research and the environment.</p><p></p><p> The Significance of Architecture:</p><p>At its roots, architectural engineering exists to make the physical environment in which individuals live, but architecture is more than fair the built environment, it’s moreover a portion of our culture. It stands as a representation of how we see ourselves, as well as how we see the world. </p><p>While the concept of shield could be a reasonably basic thing, the fashion of buildings was initially formed by the climate of a specific area, what materials were promptly accessible, as well as the values of the society building them.</p><p></p><p>More than a building : </p><p>Architecture not as it were influences society on a bigger level but too on a more individual level, it can have a significant affect on its inhabitants.

How do we combat the ceaseless increment of the world’s populace, and make beyond any doubt that our cities hold our inalienable want to have a association to the characteristic environment? </p><p>There are incalculable ways that designers can proceed to evolve the occupation and react to the changing needs of our society.

		"description" : "<p><u><em>\"I have always appreciated those who dare to experiment with materials and proportions.\"-           Zaha Hadid </em></u></p><p></p><p>Striking structures and inventive plans are the trademarks of the modern Architects. Innovators accepted nothing was as well brave: their courageous glass towers, seem alter society; their planned cities guaranteed Ideal world. These dreams did not continuously come genuine, but today's 'star' architects still accept buildings can have a significant impact on individuals. Architect Frank Gehry, after all, spared the coming up short economy of Bilbao, giving the Spanish city a modern driving force as a social industry middle with his radical plan for the Guggenheim Exhibition hall there.Architect like Zaha Hadid played the major part in improvement of Post-modernism.</p><p>Progresses in innovation, especially computerisation, have upgraded the imaginative conceivable outcomes of engineering plan, in spite of the fact that designers must still consider the essentials of work and relationship to location. Other challenges for the twenty-first-century planner are vitality sparing, building time and financial contemplations. Planners work inside the worldwide economy. Exceptionally effective ones build up their claim firms, have workplaces in different cities around the world and utilize expansive staffs. The leading planners adjust creativity, innovation and usefulness with social contemplations to form distinctive and fabulous signature buildings. Since globalization tends to make a ‘sameness’, there's too an expanded require for obvious originality.</p><p><em><strong>Why is Zaha Hadid's approach unique -</strong></em></p><p>Hadid's approach to building plan is exceedingly inventive and unique. Her structures challenge past concepts of what a building ought to be. The liquid vitality of her buildings is sculptural in approach. Conceptual System — inventive in approach to a building's work and the stream of individuals towards and inside it.</p><p>Zaha Hadid's radical fashion includes a unused approach to design, with different viewpoint focuses, smooth surfaces where dividers appear to soften, ceilings show up to compress, twist and extend, and floors bend upwards. Her plans appear to deny the concept of strength customarily related with engineering. Her shapes show up to be in a steady state of alter, morphing and floating as in case in a science fiction motion picture, drawing the passerby into her individual daydream. Her structures reflect a interesting appreciation of structural frame, the accentuation on shadow and uncertainty a reference to her social roots, whereas the smoothness could be a response against the tightening influences, as she sees them, of cutting edge urban scenes.</p><p>In spite of the fact that Architect requires person motivation, it too includes a parcel of individuals. Hadid herself does not like utilizing computers, leaning toward to draw her ideas, working out theoretical spatial connections on paper. She is especially inquisitive about how the relationship of floor to divider and ceiling can be re-imagined.</p><p>Now let's look into some of her masterpiece projects.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>London Aquatic Centre,London,UK -</strong></em></p><p>The futuristic, dynamic design for the London Aquatic Centre has an organic, living quality. Its shape evokes a stingray or a crashing wave, suitable symbols for the intended function of the building. The curvilinear shapes slide gently along the foreshore as if about to slip back into the water. The overhanging curve seems to gather onlookers together protectively below it, drawing them towards the building, stimulating their involvement.</p><p>The ladder-like structures inside the glass façade inspire spectators to visually climb to the peak of the building. For those who cast their eyes downwards to the pavement, the repetitive horizontal rungs draw the eye upward, intimating a rise in expectations and ideals. Each curving rib of the roof sets up a forward surging motion in a rising crescendo, symbolising an ongoing energy within the building. The building is streamlined, flowing and highly individualistic, a fitting design for a prestigious event and for highlighting Britain's creative energy. It also highlights the exciting possibilities for architecture offered by computer-aided design. There is a strength and distinction to the design that reflects Zaha Hadid's own personality.</p><p><em><strong>Opus (2011),Dubai Omniyat Properties -</strong></em></p><p>This staggering building ought to be a stand-out in Commerce Cove, Dubai, a nation as of now known for its energizing, imaginative structural structures. It is to be a mixed-usage property with shopping outlets on the primary three floors, and the best floor advertising a ‘tranquillity zone’ total with pool and a beach. Despite its rectilinear frame it includes a solid sculptural feel. We are reminded of the glass dividers of lace windows of the Innovator Worldwide School, and the way it floats is comparable to Le Corbusier's concept of raising a building on pilotis, but the momentous part in one side of the building and the ‘carved out’ shape in another are unquestionably modern statements.</p><p>Not at all like pioneer designers who attempted to create a unmistakable ‘style’ or approach, embracing directing standards such as ‘less is more’, ‘form takes after function’, ‘a house ought to be of a slope not on a hill’, modern planners such as Zahid, Norman Cultivate and Amanda Levete appear to delight in making interesting structural articulations with each extend. To a few degree it is modern technology that is making conceivable such fiercely inventive plans.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hadid is an persuasive designer with a groundbreaking approach to plan. Numerous of her buildings are raised so as to take off the space underneath free for urban living, permitting her structures to stay liquid and active, invigorating development and dissolving classic boundaries. Hadid's buildings don't take after a set equation; her objectives are to form buildings that are right for the put and the client, and to advance a sense of optimism.</p><p>So let's take a moment to admire the complexness and harmony that Zaha Hadid have belended to create a unique spatial experience.</p><p></p><p>Sreeraj Jagan.</p>",

		"description" : "<p><u><em>\"I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats, I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going\"   - Frank Gehry</em></u></p><p></p><p>Deconstructive and genuinely extraordinary Canadian-American architect  Gehry plays with deconstructivism like no-one else. Indeed at the age of 91, the 'starchitect' is appearing no signs of ceasing.</p><p></p><p>Envision living in a rural neighborhood of Los Angeles within the 1970s. Everything on your road is ''normal'' until a neighbour Architect remodels his house. With folded metal, uncovered joists and studs, and chain-link fencing, this house looks so diverse than the colonial fashion houses around. Your neighbors do not like it; one pledges to have the Architect imprisoned, and another undermines to sue. The Architect in this story is Canadian-born, American Straight to the point Gehry, and the house is his to begin with explanation on deconstructivism which he was not captured but granted for. In 1988, Gehry's house was shown at the Exhibition hall of Present day Craftsmanship (Modern York) as an case of deconstructivist engineering. The taking after year, Gehry won the Pritzker Design Prize.</p><p></p><p>Deconstructivism is grounded within the philosophical speculations of Jacques Derrida and were applied to design within the 1980s. Deconstructivist Architects dismiss the standards of innovation, such as geometric virtue of frame and form-function relationship. Instep, they disturb the building framework and control the form. Gehry has planned numerous ''wow'' buildings which are associated with deconstructivist engineering. For numerous, he could be a 'starchitect' who twice changed the course of design. But, Gehry not one or the other characterizes himself as a deconstructivist planner nor likes to be named a starchitect. Let's see how this celebrated modeler profoundly tests in deconstructivism.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>GEHRY'S ARCHITECTURE PHILOSPHY-</strong></em></p><p>Gehry's deconstructivist design is like jazz music. He makes a dialect of engineering by ad libbing and making ''something'' unmistakable with the components of engineering. But this dialect doesn't conversation around solidarity, agreement, and clarity, like in innovation. In differentiate, Gehry extraordinary to form disharmony and visual confusion. He needs to specific feeling and make a sense of development with his buildings. In this way, Gehry sees design as craftsmanship and questions a building's implies of expression, like in form.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Gehry's Forms -</strong></em></p><p>Gehry's design works at the side design. His shapes are a combination of design. Gehry employments skewed geometry and makes heterogeneous, non-rectilinear, and curvilinear shapes that are mutilated, separated, and persistently distorted. Gehry's shapes have no virtue, redundancy, or a sense of solidness. They have a distinctive sensibility, as his buildings appear to move and continually change. Form doesn't take after work in Gehry's hands, as well. Gehry's shapes break with the presumptions of their capacities. For case, can you tell where the library is at his Guggenheim Bilbao Exhibition hall? How approximately the eatery? There's no clue from exterior, right? Gehry starts working on the shape, and the program and capacities of the building adjust to it afterward.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Gehry &amp; Structure -</strong></em></p><p>Irregular geometry could be a implies of formal aesthetic in Gehry's buildings. But it could be a basic condition as well. Structure is basic for Gehry's engineering where shape and structure ended up one. By structure, not as it were the auxiliary components (such as pillars and columns) but moreover the envelope of a building is meant. Gehry liberates the skin from its part of fair encasing the space and covering the building, and permits it to control the structure. At the Exhibition hall of Pop Culture (once in the past EMP), for illustration, the skin brings out the shake 'n' roll involvement with its undulating bends and intense corners. This ebb and flow oversees the structure, which makes disconnected inward and external geometries.</p><p></p><p>Frank Gehry was one such pioneer in this field who knows exactly what he does and plays with form and space like his toys. Even though his works have recieved a lot of criticisms over these years , all have agreed in unison the fact that his buildings are a 'marvel' to behold.</p><p></p><p><em>Sreeraj Jagan.</em></p>",

Nowadays, the collaborative part of architect  instep rests on engineers, clients, different experts, and outside firms which are  supressing the voice of the architect.It is imperative that the part of the architect be recognized more unequivocally, particularly within the planning of cities. </p><p>The Indian government’s enormous Smart Cities Mission, which points to create maintainable and citizen-friendly cities all over the nation, has done exceptionally small to incorporate structural voices into the discussion. Same goes for our heritage structures that are being supplanted by advanced structures in spite of resistance offered by architects. </p><p>As a result, architects are making endeavors and are routinely making stages that can provide a way to  superior design.Various worldwide architectural traditions are too making openings of expanded perceivability. Here, major discourses on burning points such as maintainability and the green development, integration of urban arranging and engineering, and the part of architect in  arranging the cities, are being investigated.</p><p>These conversations about how architecture professionals can better serve society are also included in conversations  between architects, governmental bodies, environmentalists, citizens and psychologists.</p><p>Women’s support within the field is certainly developing around the world, but especially in India, where they are contributing to architecture  and arranging in a bunch of ways and are holding definitive positions.This is a far cry from the gender-biased profession architecture was in India even a decade back. Needless to say, on many forums, it is the women who are initiating changes.</p><p></p><p><em>Sreeraj Jagan.</em></p><p></p>",

		"description" : "<p><u><em>As more of us flock to urban living, city designers are re-thinking buildings’ influence on our moods in an era of “neuro-architecture”.</em></u></p><p></p><p>We now know, for example, that buildings and cities can affect our mood and well-being, and that specialised cells in the hippocampal region of our brains are attuned to the geometry and arrangement of the spaces we inhabit.People generally prefer free flowing or organic lines than strictly articulated lines,it makes them feel more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Yet urban architects have often paid scant attention to the potential cognitive effects of their creations on a city’s inhabitants. The imperative to design something unique and individual tends to override considerations of how it might shape the behaviours of those who will live with it. That could be about to change.</p><p>Because of psychological studies, we have a much better idea of the kind of urban environments that people like or find stimulating. Some of these studies have attempted to measure subjects’ physiological responses in situ, using wearable devices such as bracelets that monitor skin conductance (a marker of physiological arousal), smartphone apps that ask subjects about their emotional state, and electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets that measure brain activity relating to mental states and mood.</p><p>The importance of urban design goes far beyond feel-good aesthetics. A number of studies have shown that growing up in a city doubles the chances of someone developing schizophrenia, and increases the risk for other mental disorders such as depression and chronic anxiety.</p><p></p><p>The main trigger appears to be the “social stress” – the lack of social bonding and cohesion in neighbourhoods.Urban living can change brain biology in some people, resulting in reduced gray matter in the right dosolateral prefrontal cortex and the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, two areas where changes have previously been linked to early-life stressful experiences.</p><p>It sounds counterintuitive: surely the sheer number of people makes social interaction more likely. While this may be true superficially, the kind of meaningful social interactions that are crucial for mental health do not come easily in cities. Social isolation is now recognised by urban authorities as a major risk factor for many illnesses. Is it possible to design against it, to build in a way that encourages connection?</p><p>Visual complexity of natural environments acts as a kind of mental balm.</p><p>Sreeraj Jagan.</p><p></p>",

		"title" : "Boss Design: Adapting to the Demands of Flexible Workspaces",
		"description" : "<p>The demands and expectations of the workplace have shifted dramatically over the last two years. The mission statement of the office is being re-drafted and its role and function re-defined. Mark Barrell, Design Director at global furniture manufacturer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/microsite/boss-design/3101773?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Boss Design</a>, argues that the advance of hybrid or blended work – and 80 per cent of Boss’ clients have adopted that model – means that offices must become 'destination spaces', or rather a series of different destination spaces.</p><p>Crucially, Barrell says, time in the shared workplace is now less a matter of routine and prescribed shifts than purpose. And people will need different types of workspace depending on that purpose. </p><p>The office is now primarily a place to connect with company culture, collaborate with teammates and to learn or pass on learning, says Barrell. Head-down, focused desk work will still happen but ranks upon ranks of desks and task chairs is clearly an outdated model of office organization. \"The best working environments offer a combination of work, interaction and relaxation,\" he says.</p><p><strong>Reimagining the wingback chair</strong></p><p>Barrell argues that a key trend at the moment is a softening of office fixtures and fittings, not a forced or contrived domestication, but a greater emphasis on comfort and more relaxed settings.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/microsite/boss-design/3101773?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Boss</a>' new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/product/boss-design-amelia-wing-chair-steel-4-leg/20237140?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Amelia</a>&nbsp;wingback chair exemplifies that trend.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/microsite/boss-design/3101773?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Boss</a>&nbsp;designer Aaron Clarkson wanted to create an iconic silhouette that could stand the test of time but also a chair that had a visual and actual softness and tactility. With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/product/boss-design-amelia-wing-chair-steel-4-leg/20237140?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Amelia</a>, Clarkson elegantly re-imagines the traditional wingback as a single, gently curving form and has worked with Boss' master upholsterers to ensure that multiple fabrics work seamlessly with his simple organic lines. In the office environment, Amelia becomes a kind of instant comfortable cocoon, offering visual and acoustic privacy. Amelia can also be configured with one of four different bases and with standard or plush upholstery.</p><p><strong>Modular, flexible workspaces</strong></p><p>While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/collection/boss-design-pods/3101773/4003101/1?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">work pods</a>&nbsp;offer welcome private space, Barrell argues that most fall short as pleasant, productive places to be. Boss’ new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/product/boss-design-mews-focus/20237148?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Mews modular pod system</a>&nbsp;offers softer and more textured natural materials but also better acoustics, air quality and video conference-friendly lighting. As Barrell says, Teaming, Zooming and similar are now a permanent feature of working life and Boss worked with photographers and videographers when creating the lighting for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/product/boss-design-mews-focus/20237148?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Mews</a>, ensuring your onscreen presence is as polished as possible.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.architonic.com/en/product/boss-design-mews-focus/20237148?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Mews pod system</a>&nbsp;has also been designed to create usable working and meeting space between pods, which can also be curtained off for privacy. \"We feel like successful workplace planning, now perhaps more than ever, relies on high levels of flexibility, modularity and adaptability,\" says Barrell.</p><p>Credits : Archdaily</p>",

Which has presently,with time ended up terminated, so the question is: </p><p>What changed or what has got updated?</p><p>Whereas the more youthful era in homes where individuals related with architecture  developed up observing their predecessors from a corner, for hours, on a long wooden table over sheets. A long gaze right at the drawing sheets attempting to comprehend what it may cruel, but having way as well numerous plans and charts to get a handle on at one go over the different sizes and sorts of sheets would make it a complex job.</p><p>There was a time, bundles of handwritten paper notes for recording college works, site observations, lectures, and detailed notes, now turned into mobile applications and digitized data. It was grueling at those times to duplicate as one had to redraw the sheets from scratch with glass copying, in contrast, to present time, the presence of software and technologies has resulted in achieving tasks at a lightning speed. </p><p>At first, the studio spaces were identical to a expansive workshop with parcels of tables and drafters involving a tremendous sum of floor plans. It had a huge capacity region to store past venture drawing sheets, presently fair constrained to a computer work area. Overwhelming devices and cluttered workspaces have been supplanted by advanced working ranges, hi-tech computer program frameworks with effective computer handling speed, and huge information capacity. </p><p>The assignment to spread out notes, location photographs, and estimations on a clear sheet of paper and after that start by choosing the organize of the introduction sheet has presently been ruled out. It is much more easy and helpful to form standardized and Convertable record designs whereas recording information and plan applications. With the nearness of these devices, it makes the working stream much smoother and communicative as the records can be shared and worked totally different designs and program applications without any bother.</p><p>As for design interventions, technological advancements have resulted in 3D visualization over virtual and augmented reality. The design perceptions have become a way stronger to understand and visualize before they are built. This software gives spot-on feedback and analysis ranging from structural modification to material selection for climatic analysis of the building design along with space formation and nature of design, guides towards rectifications, and eventually saves cost. It leads a long way from the design boards with the integration of material samples, fell images, and reference drawings.</p><p>By distant, we have come a long way in innovative progressions that have overwhelmed the industry extricating virtuous headways and accomplishments. It has more or less reduced our burdens and comforted our worklife  with quick and simple arrangements. It indeed has recognized us of our overwhelming reliance but made us realize that indeed in case we are encompassed by such tech-giants has been a interesting involvement however we must not lose touch with essential human abilities.</p><p><em>Sreeraj J.</em></p>",

		"description" : "<p>The floor is one of the largest areas of coverage of an environment, and therefore, its choice goes through several criteria related to both aesthetic and visual identity issues, as well as technical issues of resistance and maintenance. It is common to use different floors for areas with different uses and often this transition is not marked by walls or doors. Next, we will bring you tips on how to make this transition harmoniously when there is no physical boundary between the floors.</p><p>We are used to using different floors to demarcate areas with different uses: kitchen and dining room, living room and balcony, or even living room and hallway, for example. This demarcation is almost always accompanied by walls and doors that define the limit of each activity and also of each floor – therefore, in each environment, the appropriate treatment is given to each type of floor installed.</p><p>In contemporary architecture, however, with the popularization of open plans and integrated spaces, it is increasingly common to sectorize spaces and organize flows based on smoother transitions such as furniture, small gaps, lowered ceilings, or even, changing floors. This change can be a simple change of material and paging, but it can also be the insertion of a decorative element, called \"carpet\", in a portion of the floor. For both situations, you need to think about how to combine different materials, textures and shapes.</p><p>The most common is to mark the transition between wet and dry area, as is the case with kitchens integrated with dining rooms. In this division, we often see the combination of warm floor, which can be wood, vinyl or laminate, with cold floor in the kitchen, which can be porcelain, ceramic or even hydraulic tile or granite.</p><p>Written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/author/giovana-martino\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Giovana Martino</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>",

Whereas times are gradually changing, a few firms have made a ponder exertion to create their workplaces more efficient and equal by advancing sex uniformity. Firms that have made a commitment to building an inclusive, representative team are able to reap the benefits of all that women have to offer the profession.</p><p>Surveys shows that while women account for nearly half of graduates from architecture programs, they only make up about 15 percent of licensed architects.

		"title" : "5 BEST PERGOLA DESIGNS WITH ROOF TO CREATE A STUNNING GARDEN FEATURE",
		"description" : "<p>Everyone recognises a pergola; they are typically made of wood but can also be made of sturdy stones, with four columns supporting a slatted top. They add shade, structural definition, and a sense of privacy to any outdoor space, making them ideal for seating areas. Such areas can be easily transformed into a garden bar or kitchen. However, when it comes to&nbsp;<strong>pergola designs with roo</strong>f, there are numerous options that are available.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, before learning more about these&nbsp;<strong>pergola designs ideas</strong>, it is essential to know what exactly they are. Start from the basics as we take you on a delightful journey in this blog.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What Is A Pergola?</strong></h2><p>A pergola is a wide-open, wall-less structure with four support beams and a fancy roof design, such as a lattice. Unlike other backyard accents, Pergolas do not typically have a protective roof because its primary purpose is not to shield the users.&nbsp;</p><p>You can install screens on the walls and roof of your pergola to provide shade and protection against natural elements. People are often searching for&nbsp;<strong>pergola designs with roo</strong>f to find the best way to cover the open area of their pergola during harsh weather conditions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Pergola Designs With Roof</strong></h2><p><br></p><h3><strong>Stone Pergola</strong></h3><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worldofstones.com/product_catelogs/pergola-collection\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">stone pergola</a>&nbsp;is a classic choice that looks fantastic with complementing outdoor decor. However, if your space is prone to temperamental weather, a bit more shelter overhead may be in order.</p><p>Consider purchasing some climbing plants to create a canopy of fragrant blossoms around your stone pergola and on the pergola designs with roof. Roses, jasmine, and honeysuckle are ideal for a romantic, cottage-garden look and will add a touch of romance to any outdoor seating area or pathway. You can also make a stone pergola look more spacious by using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worldofstones.com/blog/stones-to-make-your-patio-look-more-spacious\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">natural stone paving&nbsp;</a>beneath it.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Fabric Covering</strong></h3><p>Most homeowners choose water-resistant materials to add a layer of protection to the space below from the sun and rain. Such pergolas are made out of long-lasting fabric stretched across the rafters. You can choose to install a simple fabric or a printed material to suit the aesthetic appeal of your place.</p><p>The biggest problem with this&nbsp;<strong>pergola designs with roof</strong>&nbsp;is that water, dirt, and debris can cause mould or mildew to grow on the cloth. This is often impossible to remove, necessitating the installation of new panels.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Retractable Canopies</strong></h3><p>Retractable roofing is a practical and modern pergola designs alternative since it gives you the full pergola experience while also allowing you to retract the roof as if it never existed.</p><p><br></p><p>It begins as a full-roof pergola, shielding greater regions from the elements. This option is also available in motorised variants, which means you will not have to perform any manual effort every time you want to relax in your pergola. Such a setting is extremely useful if you are looking to shelter a hot tub or comfy sofa from the weather.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Steel Pergola</strong></h3><p>People living in cities with harsh weather conditions can also opt for steel pergolas. Such pergolas last longer compared to other materials but are not so popular due to their appearance. You can get the steel structure painted or covered in some other material to make it more attractive. But many of such options are not sustainable and hence not recommended.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Bamboo</strong></h3><p>You can design and install an overhead framework made of bamboo canes to give your pergola a rustic look. If you install the pergola on a pathway, these canes could be fixed over trees instead of stone pillars. Over the years, the branches from these trees will crawl on the bamboo net and make a green shade over the pathway.</p><p><br></p><p>Such features could give your garden or backyard a distinctly natural feel. You can create a unique pergola designs attached to house using bamboo and other natural material.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Pergola Designs With Roof: What Should You Choose?</strong></h2><p>There is an elegance to pergola designs with roof. More importantly, they provide function and durability, the latter of which heavily relies on the material of the roof.</p><p>Choose what is best for you based on the weather conditions in your area. Stone, for example, is one of the best materials suited for pergola roof designs. It fits almost every kind of design. These can be useful because they can be easily illuminated with recessed spotlights and support other design ideas. A Pergola coupled with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worldofstones.com/blog/natural-stones-for-outdoor-space\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">natural stone flooring</a>&nbsp;can also provide aesthetic appeal to your outdoor space.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Design is about more than simply creativity; it's also about common sense. Consider how often you will be using your pergola and at what times of the year when choosing a roof. The best option for your home is determined by your particular design aesthetics and what you require for maximum functionality. However, if you choose to install a stone pergola at your home, consider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worldofstones.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">World of Stones</a>&nbsp;to get the best quality and roof pergola designs.</p>",

		"description" : "<p><strong>SUSTAINABILITY IN ARCHITECTURE</strong></p><p> Sustainability in architecture addresses the negative natural and social impacts of buildings by utilizing plan strategies, materials, vitality and improving spaces that aren’t negative to the encompassing biological system or communities. The logic is to guarantee that the activities taken nowadays don’t have negative results for future eras and comply with the standards of social, financial and biological sustainability. </p><p>Firstly, supportability in design ought to take under consideration the characteristic assets and conditions at the location, consolidating these into the plan wherever possible. It moreover implies utilizing materials that minimize the structure’s natural impression, whether that be due to energy-intensive fabricating forms or long transport distances. Sustainable architects and builders should also consider employing systems into the design that harness waste and reuse it in as efficient a manner as possible.</p><p><em>How to attain sustainability in Architecture</em></p><p>Sustainability in architecture starts with investigation and research. The primary step is to carry out an assessment of the location to decide the natural conditions and limitations that ought to be taken under consideration. Usually take time to check on neighborhood feactures, controls and prerequisites or meet with pertinent people to talk about your specific project. </p><p><em>Sustainability within built environment</em></p><p>When individuals build things, numerous process take place to actualize the plan. The objective of a economical building venture is to utilize materials and forms that will have small affect on the existing environment. For example, utilizing nearby building materials and neighborhood laborers limits the contamination impacts of transportation. Non-polluting construction methodologies must have small hurt on the land, ocean and atmosphere. Protecting environment and remediating harmed landscapes can switch harms caused by past eras.</p><p>To achieve true sustainability we have to  adjust financial, social and natural components in equal harmony. Business and financial practicality are an vital portion of the supportability condition. Without it, sustainability wouldn’t be feasible.</p><p>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<em>Energy and Resource Efficiency</em></p><p>Sustainable design is supported by a reasoning that advocates maintainable energy sources. Where possible steps are taken to plan for energy efficiency, counting the utilize of renewable energy sources such as wind, geothermal and sun based. A sustainable architect perceives that the energy proficiency of buildings can be expanded in a assortment of ways. A building can be arranged to require full advantage of regular changes within the sun’s position, and energy-efficient lighting and apparatuses can be introduced. Vitality preservation is additionally key: buildings can be ‘weatherised’ for most extreme security against the misfortune of warm or cool discuss, and fitting protection materials and window glazing can be introduced to diminish warm misfortune in ways that don't cause indoor humidity.</p><p>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<em>Efficient use of space</em></p><p>The sustainable architect recognises the importance of indoor environmental quality for affecting how an individual feels in a space and focuses on features such as a healthy indoor environment with adequate ventilation, temperature control, and the use of materials that do not emit toxic gases. The incorporation of earth shelters, roof gardens, and extensive planting throughout and around buildings is also encouraged. </p><p>&nbsp;•&nbsp;<em>Environment-friendly building materials</em></p><p>A sustainable architect ordinarily chooses to utilize environmentally-friendly building materials. The foremost alluring materials are those that are reused or renewable, as well as those that require the least energy to make. There's frequently a focus on utilizing locally-obtained woods and stone, decreasing the distance that materials travel some time recently being utilized within the development process and supporting neighborhood exchanges. There's a inclination for wood that's collected mindfully from certified woodlands and all other materials are non-synthetic and non-toxic. Reusing is at the heart of a sustainable architect’s design.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em>Sreeraj Jagan.</em></p>",

It accommodates the floor plan requirements inside a volume only 4 meters wide, resulting in a thin and compact prism. On each level small outdoor spaces are inserted, allowing for a rich spatial experience while keeping the necessary privacy in a dense residential neighborhood. This sequence encompasses a courtyard on the basement level, a garden with a swimming pool on the ground floor and a double-height terrace on the first floor to expand and complement the tight interior of the house. Thus, the usual sequence of stacked levels is challenged and turned into a dynamic vertical landscape.</p><p>The basement is illuminated through a dug patio that occupies the entire front of the plot. Over this void, a bridge connects the street directly to the garden and the entrance of the house.&nbsp;</p><p>The ground floor opens into the garden and the pool, which runs longitudinally along the edge. On this level, the living room and kitchen have large windows that allow the continuity of these spaces. Large perforated metal sliding shutters nuance the light. The circular cutouts of the sliding doors become the identity of the house.&nbsp;</p><p>Architects : <strong>Murado &amp; Elvira</strong></p>",

For students, it is easier to study in a bright place, artists look for inspiring atmospheres, and our mood can improve with the right color scheme. These aspects are also important for kindergartens, daycare centers and schools, because a child-friendly design can stimulate the curiosity and imagination of children, so that they learn in a playful way. The design of a room supports the learning and creativity of children.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/tag/daylight\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Daylight</a>&nbsp;systems, for example, flood rooms with light, making them appear larger and friendlier.</p><p>Design plays an important role&nbsp;in ensuring that the various functional corners in an educational space are separated from one another. In order to use room design as part of education,&nbsp;as seen in numerous pedagogical concepts recommended&nbsp;by Maria Montessori, planners should pay attention to a few key factors. Since walls, windows and doors provide color, acoustics and light in the room, they have an enormous influence on the atmosphere. With a well thought-out choice of components, you can create a concept that gives the children freedom and security.&nbsp;</p><p>Natural light makes spaces look larger and friendlier. With enough space, children can discover their surroundings in a stimulating way. At the same time, brightness signals a feeling of security to the children. When they can see their environment, play partners and caregivers clearly, they feel more secure when exploring and playing. With a suitable color scheme and other details, the room becomes a child-friendly place to learn.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lamilux.com/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">LAMILUX</a>&nbsp;has been manufacturing daylight systems made from plastic, glass and aluminum for 70 years, used in commercial buildings and industrial shed complexes, as well as private residences. The purpose of these structures primarily consists in optimizing the use of natural light and guiding it into building interiors.

		"description" : "<p>he inspiration for this project started in 2020 during the early months of the pandemic. Ganguli's university friends from India sent him pictures of a super cyclone that occurred in the Sundarbans. This disaster caused billions of dollars in damage to many properties and resulted in other losses in the area. Ganguli grew up close to the Sundarbans and felt a deep calling to act. However, there wasn't much he or his colleagues could do to help.</p><p>At the same time, Ganguli's company Somnium London Limited was developing an innovative product to recycle mixed-use plastic and multi-layer plastic. Ganguli read an article that broke down statistics on what happens to plastic after its use, and he was astounded by the amount of waste produced. This information led Ganguli and his team to develop the product.&nbsp;</p><p>With both of these ideas in mind, the design team at Somnium London Limited decided to bring them together in a comprehensive design for the competition. The team could use the product to create innovative building materials to construct carbon positive, affordable housing. The recycled plastic would stand as a monolithic material used in marine setup, building walls in a modular format, building a panel format for the roofs, decks for the river docks, and even creating boats for the fishermen.</p><p>Saumya Ganguli is a London-based, Indian-British, award-winning international architect with over 23 years of post-qualification experience in the building industry. He has been involved in the design and construction of several iconic megaprojects around the globe, across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and India.&nbsp;Ganguli&nbsp;has a proven track record of design directorship, team leadership, and successful project delivery of complex international projects, specializing in aviation/ transportation facilities design and high-end high-rise mixed-use projects.</p>",
